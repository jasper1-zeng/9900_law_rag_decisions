(This application was heard on 8 January 2025. An oral decision was\ndelivered on 9 January 2025. The following reasons comprise\nthe reasons that\nwere delivered orally, subject only to minor editing to improve clarity of\nexpression and setting out.)\n\nIntroduction\n\n The\napplicant, Giabeni Proprietary Limited (\nGiabeni\n) is the owner of Lot 12\non strata plan 11321 (\nstrata plan\n). Ms Jocelyn O'Donnell is the director\nof the applicant and resides at Lot 12. \n\n The\nrespondent is The Owners of 30 Coode Street Mount Lawley Strata Scheme 11321\n(\nstrata company\n). The strata company is the body corporate established\nunder \ns 14\n of the \nStrata Titles Act 1985\n (WA) (\nST Act\n) on\nregistration by the Register of Titles of the strata titles scheme on 24\nFebruary 1983 and comprises 16 lots (\nstrata scheme\n). It is located\nin the suburb of Mount Lawley, and is described on the strata plan as\nfollows:\n\nBrick and iron home units wholly contained within the external boundaries of\nportion of Swan Location Y and being Lot 100 on\nDiagram\n64201.\n\n On\n8 September 2024, Giabeni commenced the proceeding in the Tribunal under s\n197(4) of the ST Act to resolve a scheme dispute at\nthe strata scheme.\n\n The\nrespondent informed the Tribunal at the hearing that this matter is the sixth\nlegal proceeding which the applicant has commenced\nagainst the respondent since\nit bought into the complex in 2022. Two of those legal proceedings have been in\nthe Magistrates Court\nand four in the Tribunal. Furthermore, the respondent\nstated that the applicant had very recently commenced a new proceeding which\nis\nlisted for a first directions hearing in the near future. \n\n Ms\nO'Donnell is a strata manager by profession and it became evident to the\nTribunal during the hearing that, at least in relation\nto some issues, she was\nusing the Tribunal as a first option in order to attempt to resolve matters in\ndispute between the parties\nrather than attempting to work with the Council\nof Owners (\nCOO\n) (for example the alleged issue relating to the driveway\nwhich I will return to later in these reasons). \n\n It\nbecame clear at the hearing that the relationship between the parties has\ncompletely broken down and there is significant mistrust\non both sides. It was\nalso evident that the members of the COO of the complex (all of whom work full\ntime and are volunteers) have\nsuffered significant stress as a result of the\ncontinuing legal proceedings instigated by the applicant. The respondent\ninformed\nme that on the advice of the City of Vincent (\nCity\n) they have\ntaken steps to try and ease the pressure concerning communications with Ms\nO'Donnell by establishing a service level agreement\nto regulate the time spent\nby the COO responding to complaints by owners.\n\n There\nare six issues which are in dispute between the parties all of which relate to\nthe maintenance of the common property and which\nare broadly in the categories\nof:\n(1) rubbish bins;\n(2) parking in visitors' bays;\n(3) gardening;\n(4) repair of soakwells;\n(5) an alleged raised driveway; and\n(6) the installation of a gate at the end of Lot 12.\n\n Giabeni\nsays orders from the Tribunal are necessary because the strata company has not\ndemonstrated a genuine attempt to maintain\nthe common property.\n\n The\nstrata company disagrees and says that their actions in relation to the above\nissues are reasonable in the circumstances. \n\n I\nheard the matter yesterday, 8 January 2024, over a long hearing day. \nMs O'Donnell gave evidence for the applicant. The strata\ncompany called\nthree witnesses, Ms Kelly Tyrrell, Mr Robert Patrick and Ms Jessica Gatt.\n\n The\nTribunal prepared a Hearing Book containing all of the documents filed by the\nparties in accordance with the programming orders\nof Senior Member O'Sullivan on\n29 October 2024 which was Exhibit 1. Exhibit 2 was a hand drawn sketch by the\nrespondent of the laneway\narea.\n\n The\nTribunal notes that both parties filed additional documents subsequent to the\ndocuments which were not filed in accordance with\nany order of the Tribunal and\nwhich consisted of responses to each other's statement of issues, facts and\ncontentions and some additional\ndocuments. At the commencement of the hearing,\nI determined that these documents would not be included in the Hearing Book as\nthey\nwere generally repetitive in nature and the parties could also raise any\nnew issues by way of cross-examination. Further, I found\nthat it would not be\nconsistent with the objectives of \ns 9\n of the \nState Administrative Tribunal\nAct 2004\n (WA), (in particular to determine matters speedily and informally),\nto allow the endless filing of documents.\n\nDecision\n\n For\nthe following reasons, I have decided that Giabeni's application in its entirety\nis unsuccessful and I will dismiss the application.\n\nLegislation\n\n The\nproceeding comes within the Tribunal's original jurisdiction (s 209 of the\nST Act).\n\n Part\n13 of the ST Act deals with Tribunal proceedings.\n\n In\nproceedings under the ST Act, the Tribunal may make any order it considers\nappropriate to resolve the dispute or proceeding (s\n200(1) of the ST Act). The\ntypes of orders that the Tribunal may make are set out in s 200 of the ST\nAct.\n\n It\nis also possible for the Tribunal to make a decision not to make an order or\ndeclaration. This is provided for in s 202 of the\nST Act.\n\n I\nam satisfied that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under s 197(4) of the\nST Act to determine the dispute between Giabeni and the strata\ncompany as\nit is a scheme dispute between scheme participants as those terms are defined in\nthe ST Act. \n\nPrinciples\n\n The\nprinciples which guide the Tribunal's discretion as to whether or not to make an\norder were set out by Member Petrucci in a previous\ndecision involving the\nparties, namely \nGiabeni Pty Limited and The Owners of 30 Coode Street\nMount Lawley Strata Plan 11321\n \n 2024 WASAT 105\n (\nPrevious\nDecision\n) at 37 - 39 and I respectfully adopt those principles when\ndetermining whether or not to make orders. \n\n In\nthis case the following paragraphs of the Tribunal in the decision of \nThe\nOwners of Mandurah Terrace Apartments Strata Plan 17133 and Russell\n\n \n 2009 WASAT 1\n at \n 59 \n - 60 is of particular assistance and\nrelevance to this matter:\n\nIn\ndealing with whether or not a strata company has unreasonably refused to do that\nwhich it allegedly should have done, the Tribunal\n\nhas consistently taken an\napproach that the management of a strata company is best left to the\nstrata company and that the Tribunal\nshould not too readily impose its own\nviews of what is unreasonable\n. See, for example, \nHopkins and Clayton\n\n \n 2007 WASAT 255.\n At the same time, the legislature has intended that there be\na practicable means of breaking deadlocks between the members of a\nstrata\ncompany who are co-owners of the common property, live often in close proximity,\nand who should desire to live in harmony\nwith each other.\n\nThe\nTribunal has fulfilled that role in circumstances where resolutions proposed to\na strata company have failed whether due to the\ndissent of a single lot owner,\nor of a majority of lot owners, by examining the rationale for dissent to\nascertain whether there\nis a sensible basis for dissent. This necessarily means\nthat the \nTribunal is drawn into a balancing of interests and views and must\ninevitably reach a subjective view of whether the decision is unreasonable.\n If\nthat balance is delicately poised it will not be possible to conclude that the\ndecision is unreasonable. It is possible for\npersons acting reasonably to come\nto opposite conclusions on the same set of facts. \n(Emphasis\nadded)\n\n The\nprinciples which concern the general duty of a strata company to control and\nmanage the common property were set out by Member\nPetrucci in the Previous\nDecision at 116 - 121 and I also respectfully adopt those principles when\ndetermining this matter.\n\n In\nsummary, as Member Petrucci observed, if there is evidence of an adequate\nprocess adopted by the strata company, the practical\nobjective of which is to\nkeep the common property in good and serviceable repair; properly maintained and\nwhere necessary renew or\nreplace the common property, then the strata company\nhas discharged the duty imposed by s 91(1)(c) of the ST Act even if, at any\ngiven time, the common property is in a deteriorated\nstate.\n\nIssues\n\n I\nnow turn to consider the issues in turn.\n\nIssue 1 - rubbish bins\n\n The\ncomplex utilises a shared bin system and the applicant wishes to change from\nthis system to a single use system (Order 7) or,\nalternatively if this is not\ngranted, to increase the cleaning of the bins to monthly (Order 6). In her\nclosing submission the applicant\nalso suggested an alternative order, namely\nthat the existing bins be stored behind the letterboxes at the front of the\ncomplex.\n\n The\nexact location of the bins over the years was disputed between the parties,\nhowever it was not disputed and I find that a single\nuse system has never been\nin place and I also find that at least from the time the applicant purchased her\nproperty the bins were\nlocated outside her property (her own evidence was that\nthey were banging along the asbestos fence).\n\n I\nwill address Order 7 first given it is the preferred order of the applicant\nrelating to this issue.\n\nOrder 7 - to return bins to single use management\n\n The\napplicant says that the bins are misused and as a result are smelly, attract\nrodents and the area in which the bins are located\nencourages illegal dumping of\nitems such as unwanted household furniture. Ms O'Donnell's questioning of\nthe witnesses (for example\nwhether the bins could be viewed from the master\nbedroom window) also suggests that she finds the view of the bins aesthetically\nunpleasing. She also states that the enclosure for the bins is too small\nand that the current system which requires rubbish trucks\nto reverse to collect\nthe bins is dangerous, particularly for children. \n\n The\nrespondent does not support replacing the existing bin arrangement for numerous\nreasons including:\n\nconcerns about\nlot owners' capacity to store three bins within their units which would\ndisproportionately disadvantage the 10/16 units\nwhich have small courtyards,\nmany of whom use such courtyards as entertaining areas and whom bought their\nproperties on the basis\nthat they would have full use of those courtyards and\nnot have to use them as a bin storage area;\n\nconcerns about\nthe fact that the residents would have to transport their single use bins to one\nof the two verges up to a potential\ndistance of 75 metres (noting that there is\na difference between walking a distance to a bin to dispose of rubbish bags as\ncompared\nto wheeling a heavy bin over a distance and over a verge);\n\nthe respondent\nsays that the City has raised concerns about the capacity of the verges to\nservice the bins, which advice has repeatedly\nbeen given; and\n\nthere is no\nevidence that a change in the bin system would address illegal dumping (which is\nin any event a rare issue).\n\n Two\nof the respondent's witnesses (Mr Patrick and Ms Gatt) gave evidence that they\nhave not experienced any of the same concerns\nabout odour and vermin in relation\nto the bins and that the only person who has complained about the bins from\nwithin the complex\nis the applicant.\n\n Furthermore,\nthe respondent points out that the applicant has raised this issue at two Annual\nGeneral Meetings (\nAGMs\n), and it has been overwhelming defeated.\n\nSingle use bins - decision\n\n I\nfind that the respondent has not acted unreasonably in refusing to implement a\nsingle use bin system. In my view there are two\nfactors which are of particular\nrelevance to this issue, firstly the fact that the strata company has rejected\nthis proposal on two\nprevious occasions and secondly that the applicant bought\nher unit in full knowledge of the existing arrangement.\n\n I\nfind on the basis of the evidence that the only lot owner from within the\ncomplex that has complained about the alleged unhygienic\nstate of the bins is\nthe applicant. I accept that there is evidence before the Tribunal that the\nbins have been misused on occasions,\nparticularly that items which cannot be\nrecycled are placed in the yellow bins. The applicant also complained that\nthe bins are\noverfull on occasion and the lids cannot be closed, however in my\nview this may also occur with a single use system.\n\n However,\nthe evidence presented by the applicant does not go so far as to establish that\nthere is significant misuse of the bins\non an ongoing basis which has resulted\nin them becoming unhygienic or unsanitary or attracting vermin. The one\nincident of a dead\nrat by the bin (which I accept, despite the evidence of Mr\nPatrick, is more likely to be a rat and not a quenda) is insufficient\nto\nestablish that there is a problem with the bins attracting rats over and above\nany other suburban bin. \n\n The\napplicant also relied on an unsigned letter (1 July 2022) written by Mr Martin\nand Ms Goode who are former owners of a different\nstrata complex and whom\nresided in a unit which is a similar distance from the bins as the applicant's\nunit. This letter complains\nabout issues of odour, untidiness and vermin. \nHowever, the authors of the letter were not present for cross-examination and\ntherefore\nlimited weight can be placed on their evidence. \n\n Further,\nthe respondent called Ms Tyrrell to give evidence who resided in that same unit\n(after Mr Martin and Ms Goode) during 2023\nand 2024. I accept her evidence that\nshe resided in the same unit during the summers of 2023 and 2024 and did not\nexperience any\nsimilar issues, even when she removed four large olive trees\nbetween her unit and the bins. She maintained her evidence under\ncross-examination.\n\n The\nevidence of the respondent was that the COO regularly inspect the bins and have\nnot found them in an unsanitary condition and\nany isolated incidents are\npromptly attended to by the COO.\n\n The\napplicant argued that because there has recently been a change to more\nowner/occupiers than tenants there will be more likely\nto be complaints about\nthe bins. However, in my view this logic does not necessarily follow and, in\nany event, the applicant has\nprovided no evidence of such complaints by recent\nowners/occupiers.\n\n Further,\nI find that there is no evidence to suggest that moving to a single use system\nwould resolve, what appears to be, the very\ninfrequent issue of illegal dumping\nof other items.\n\n I\nalso find that the respondent has an adequate system in place to deal with this\nwhen it occurs, for example the evidence given\nby Ms Gatt as to the shopping\ntrolley which was recently abandoned and the removal of the large olive branch\nwhich was also recently\ndumped. \n\n I\nalso agree with the concerns expressed by the respondent in relation to the\npotential impact of a change in the bin system on the\nfront courtyards of the\nsmaller blocks. When I asked Ms O'Donnell about this issue, she said it was not\nfor her to work out how\nthe front courtyards of these lots were used or how it\nwould impact them. In my view, this highlights that the applicant is taking\nan\nentirely self-centered approach to this issue. I find that the implementation\nof a single use bin system would have a disproportionate\nimpact on the majority\nof the lot owners who have a smaller courtyard and that this would be unfair to\nthem given that they purchased\ntheir units with the existing arrangements in\nplace. Further, the evidence of Mr Patrick was to the effect that if the bins\nwere\nstored in the small front courtyards, not only would the space in and\namenity of those courtyards be affected, the view of the courtyard\nfrom the\nlounge rooms of those units would be of the bins.\n\n The\napplicant also suggested that the single use bins could be stored out the front\nof the units on the existing garden beds. However,\nI find that this is not a\nreasonable alternative for the following reasons:\n\nthere is no\nevidence to suggest that the bins would physically fit in those areas and Mr\nPatrick gave evidence that he was unsure\nif they would fit;\n\nthere is\nevidence of lighting and gas meters (from Mr Patrick) in those areas which would\ncause access issues;\n\nthere is\ncurrently soft sand in the area and this would need to be concreted for\nhardstands for the bins and pathways; and\n\nthe areas are\ndesignated to be used as gardens, not bin storage areas. Whilst they are in a\nbarren state at present, the respondent\nhas indicated that the plan is to\nrejuvenate the garden. Therefore, even if the other issues of physical space\nand access could\nbe overcome, I would remain of the view that this is not a\nreasonable alternative. \n\n There\nwas some dispute in the evidence between the parties as to the length of time it\ntook the rubbish truck to empty the bins (the\nrespondent's measurement of\ntime was just under two minutes, whereas the applicant's was over five minutes).\nHowever, in my view,\na five minute window on a weekly or even bi-weekly basis\nfor emptying bins is not unreasonable in a suburban area. Further there\nis no\nevidence before the Tribunal about the danger to children posed by reversing\ntrucks, any more than there is always the potential\nfor danger to children by\nvehicles in a suburban area. The uncontested evidence of the respondent was\nalso that the bins were usually\ncollected during school hours. \n\n In\nmy view the above factors would be sufficient to resolve this issue. However, I\nhave also had regard to the views of the City.\n It is clear that ultimately the\ndecision about the bins was one for the strata company and not the City. The\noriginal correspondence\nfrom the City on the issue suggested there may be room\nfor the bins if both verges are utilised. However, the communication of 4\nDecember 2024 at page 716 of Exhibit 1 confirms the respondent's statements\nto the city that:\n\n...\n\nIt's not\nsuitable or practical to have individual bins due to no space provision on\nproperty lots.\n\nThere isn't\nsufficient space for a weekly 24 bins verge waste collection on Coode\nStreet.\n\n For\nthe above reasons, this matter is dismissed.\n\nOrder 6 - the shared bins if retained, are to be cleaned monthly\n\n I\nfind that the bins have been cleaned once in each of the years 2022, 2023 and\n2024. There was some dispute between the parties\nas to whether this constitutes\n'annual' cleaning given that some of the cleans were not within a 12-month\nperiod.\n\n The\nposition of the respondent is that it does not support any increase in bin\ncleaning given that there have been no other complaints\nfrom within the complex\nexcept from the applicant and that she purchased the property knowing that her\nlot was located the closest\nto the bins. \n\n The\nrespondent points out again that this issue has also been contested at two AGMs\nand the majority of owners voted to keep the\nsame cleaning cycle of annually. \nThe respondent points out that between AGMs there have been new people on the\nCOO and the same\nresult was reached. \n\n I\nfind that the respondent has not acted unreasonably in declining to clean the\nbins monthly. In my view, as explained in relation\nto Order 7 above, there is\ninsufficient evidence to establish that the bins are regularly misused or in an\nunhygienic state or that\nthey are overly smelly. I remind the parties of the\nlegal principle referred to above that \nthe management of a strata\ncompany is best left to the strata company and that the Tribunal should not too\nreadily impose its own\nviews of what is unreasonable\n. \n\nMovement of the bins to the front of the complex\n\n I\nalso decline to make an order about the movement of the bins to the front of the\ncomplex. I accept the respondent's evidence that\nthis would simply shift the\nissues that the applicant says are occurring with the bins away from her and to\nanother lot owner (which\nagain indicates that her approach to this issue is\nfocussed on her own interests). \n\nIssue 2 - parking\n\n The\nprimary concern of the applicant in relation to this issue is that the eight\nvisitor car bays are used by persons who are not\nvisitors so that they are,\nas the applicant put it, deriving a benefit not afforded to anyone else. Of\nparticular concern to the\napplicant is that some lot owners who have more than\none vehicle use the visitors bays as overflow parking.\n\n The\napplicant seeks the following orders:\n\nOrder 8 That a parking agreement is entered into with the City of Stirling or a\ntowing company for those that abuse visitors parking.\n\nOrder 9 That signage and line marking is put in place for visitors\nparking.\n\nOrder 8 - parking agreements be entered into\n\n The\nposition of the respondent is that this order is not supported as it is not\nnecessary. It says that adequate visitor parking\nbays are available and points\nout that only five of the 16 lots have more than one car. It relies on a\nreview recently conducted\nby Ms Gatt, on behalf of the COO, which shows that\nthere is adequate parking available. Ms Gatt gave evidence that she collated\ndata across various dates and times documenting 132 visitors bays and there were\n89% of bays available on average at any given time.\n The review conducted by Ms\nGatt was supported by time and date stamped photographs. This evidence was not\ndisputed by the applicant.\n\n The\nrespondent submits that on the infrequent occasions where owners park in the\nvisitor parking bays the COO has a process in place\nto address the issue which\nis effective and the introduction of parking agreements is not necessary or\ndesirable. Ms Gatt's evidence,\nwhich I accept is that the COO are active in\nresponding to events which come up.\n\n The\nrespondent also points out that the applicant's motion in relation to this issue\nwas defeated at the 2024 AGM. \n\nConclusion\n\n During\nher oral evidence Ms O'Donnell stated that at times her visitors have been\nunable to use the visitor parking bays. However,\nin my view this evidence\nshould be viewed with circumspection given that she did not refer to this in her\nwitness statement or in\nher documents (either by way of statement by herself or\nby supporting statements from her visitors). I prefer the evidence of the\nrespondent which is to the effect that whilst at times owners (and other persons\nnot authorised to do so) park in the visitors parking\nbays, this is not\nfrequent, there is a system to address it and there is usually plenty of\navailable parking based on the review\ncompleted by Ms Gatt. \n\n Further,\nMs O'Donnell's own evidence was that the situation has recently improved. She\nsays, in effect, that the Tribunal can draw\nan inference that this is because\nshe has brought these proceedings. However, this is not the only reasonable\ninference the Tribunal\ncan draw about this issue. It may well be due to efforts\nmade by the COO to improve the situation. The evidence of the respondent\nwas\nthat they have a satisfactory system in place to deal with parking infractions\nwhen they occur. For example, the evidence given\nby Ms Gatt about the white\nvehicle which was left at the strata scheme over the Christmas period.\n\n In\nmy view this order is unnecessary based on the evidence by the respondent that\nthere are no or limited concerns in relation to\nvisitor parking bay availability\nand also the evidence of the respondent as to the system they have in place for\nmanaging any issues\nwhich arise. \n\nOrder 9 - signage\n\n The\napplicant also seeks for visitor parking and lines to be implemented. It\ncorrectly points out that a sum under $1,000 was allocated\nto this in year four\nof the 10-year plan (which was in 2024). \n\n The\nrespondent's position in relation to this order is that although in principle it\nsupports lines and signage, it does not support\nexpenditure on this issue at\nthis time. It submits that there are no immediate safety issues and there are\nalready natural grooves\nin the concrete which designate separate bays. Further,\nit says that the issue was voted on at the recent AGM, the outcome of which\nwas\nthat the works would be looked at when the five year review of the 10-year plan\noccurs.\n\n I\nfind that the approach taken by the strata company is not unreasonable in the\ncircumstances given the evidence about the availability\nof visitor parking bays\nreferred to earlier in these reasons and Ms O'Donnell's own evidence that the\nsituation has recently improved.\n\nIssue 3 - gardening \n\n The\norder sought by the applicant in relation to this issue is that a gardener is\nreinstated given the butchered state of the gardens\nby members of the outgoing\nCOO. During the hearing the applicant confirmed that she was in effect seeking\nan order that a new gardener\nbe appointed. \n\n I\nfind the facts to be as follows in relation to the garden:\n\nthe previous\nregular gardener Mr Neil Bees left of his own accord at the end of 2023;\n\nother gardeners\nwere engaged to complete a garden clean up;\n\none gardener\nperformed unsatisfactory work and caused some damage to the gardens and was not\npaid a full fee;\n\nMr Mick Del Caro\nhas recently been contracted to do the gardening at a cost of $550 per month;\nand\n\nMr Del Caro's\ncosts can be covered in the $6,600 in the budget allocated for gardening\ntogether with the allocated funds for reticulation\nand tree loping.\n\n I\nfind that given that a new gardener has now been appointed, and there are\nsufficient funds allocated to pay him, this matter has\nalready been\nresolved.\n\nIssue 4 - soakwells\n\n Order\n11 sought by the applicant is 'that all soak wells at 4 Third Avenue are\nattended to in the same manner as the one arranged\nby the former owner of Lot\n16'.\n\n The\nsubstance of the applicant's complaint about this issue is that the respondent\nonly repaired one soakwell in the complex instead\nof repairing all three. \n\n In\nher witness statement Ms O'Donnell alleged that the former owner (the witness Mr\nPatrick) of Lot 16 who was on the COO and who\nwas selling his property at the\ntime, gained a benefit by the strata company attending to the soakwell outside\nof his property, when\na discount could have been achieved if all three soakwells\nwere repaired at the same time.\n\n At\nthe hearing, Ms O'Donnell acknowledged that she had been mistaken about the fact\nthat the previous owner derived an advantage\nor that he was paid for overseeing\nthe work.\n\n The\nTribunal finds that the previous owner of Lot 16 derived no benefit from the\nworks done on the soakwell outside his property.\n The Tribunal notes that\nthe work on the soakwell was performed on 19 June 2024 and the owner's\nproperty settled before that on 4\nJune 2024.\n\n The\nTribunal also finds, having regard to the quotations obtained, that there was no\ndiscount offered if all three soakwells were\nrepaired at the same time. \n\n The\nTribunal also accepts the uncontested oral evidence of Mr Partick regarding\nwhy the one soakwell was repaired whereas the other\ntwo only cleaned. Mr\nPatrick stated in relation to the soakwell that was repaired as\nfollows:\n\nThe location of the soak well was at the base of hill so it had more water; that\nparticular soak well was in a bad way, the concrete\naround it was cracked, it\nwas sinking and the distance it had sunk was 3-4 inches. When water flowed down\nit was washing silt and\nsand away and was getting worse and was a trip hazard\neven though people don't walk across a drain. The other two soak wells were\nnot\nin a bad way - they had cracked concrete - we got quote for all 3 so we\ncould find what we might be up for at a later time.\n\n Mr\nPatrick also pointed out that the cost for repairing the three soakwells was\nsignificant, approximately, $28,000.\n\n The\nevidence of the respondent was that they would review the other two soakwells as\npart of its five-year review of the 10-year\nplan. \n\n I\nfind that given the comparative condition of the different soakwells and the\ncosts involved, this is an entirely reasonable approach\nfor the respondent to\ntake in the circumstances. \n\nIssue 5 - driveway \n\n Order\n12 sought by the applicant seeks that the driveway to 4 Third Avenue is shaved\nback to prevent vehicle undercarriage damage\nto vehicles entering and exiting\nthe complex.\n\n I\nfind that this driveway services Lots 13 - 16 and the four visitor parking bays\naccessed from Third Avenue. \n\n The\napplicant provided no evidence (expert or otherwise) which supports its\ncontention that there is a structural fault or issue\nwith the driveway. It has\nprovided no engineering or building report, no statements by persons whose cars\nhave been damaged and\nno photographs of any damage.\n\n As\nthe respondent points out, the applicant does not even need to use this driveway\nto access her lot. \n\n In\nresponse to a question under cross-examination, Ms O'Donnell stated that she has\nhad to direct people to Third Avenue for visitor\nparking and their\nundercarriages have been damaged. However, I do not accept this evidence given\nthat she did not refer to this\nin her witness statement or her documents and\nalso has provided no evidence of such damage.\n\n The\nrespondent's evidence about this issue was as follows:\n\nMr Patrick\nconfirmed that he was an owner of a lot on Third Avenue and he did not have\nany damage to his car or any complaints from\ntenants over 28 years; and\n\nMs Gatt gave\nevidence that she has frequently driven over that driveway in her Mazda sedan\nwhich is 21 centimetres from the ground\nand has never encountered issues with\nthe driveway damaging the undercarriage of her vehicle.\n\n The\nrespondent stated that the first time the applicant brought this issue to its\nattention was in the context of the Tribunal proceedings.\n The Tribunal\naccepts this evidence. In my view this factor would be relevant to the\nTribunal's discretion as to whether it should\nmake an order in these\ncircumstances, however in this case, the applicant has not overcome the first\nhurdle as I find that it has\nprovided no evidence to justify the order\nsought.\n\nIssue 6 - gate\n\n The\napplicant seeks, by Order 13, that a gate is installed at the end of Lot 12\nin accordance with the QIA Safety Report dated February\n2023 to prevent public\nthoroughfare through the complex.\n\n The\nevidence at the hearing establishes and I find that there is a walkway between\nthe rear fence of Lot 12 and the rear fence of\n145 Railway Parade and the\nCoode Street address. Ms Gatt gave evidence that she has used that walkway to\naccess the train station.\n The uncontested evidence was also that the\nresidents in Lots 13 - 16 use the laneway to access the bins. \n\n The\nreport is at page 87 of Exhibit 1 and contains six recommendations, two of which\nrelate to the installation of gates, one at\nLot 12 and the other facing units 3\n- 4. The only explanation given for the need for such gates was 'as the current\nsituation allows\nfor non­resident members of the general public to use the\ncommon property as a thoroughfare which increase the public liability\nrisk to\nthe property'.\n\n No\nexplanation is given as to the nature of the public liability risk identified\nbeyond that brief statement. The author of the\nreport was not called to give\nevidence. \n\n Further,\nboth parties agreed that the recommendation in the report for a second gate was\nconfusing and the location which was referred\nto was unclear. The respondent\nalso submitted that the report contained references to matters irrelevant to the\nstrata complex such\nas balconies and metal balustrades.\n\n The\nevidence of Mr Patrick was that this report was obtained by the strata company\nupon recommendation by the Strata Manager. \n\n Mr\nPatrick's evidence was that the recommendation for the gate was noted but the\ndecision of the strata company was not to go ahead\nas there had been no problems\nwith the public moving through the complex. He stated that if a gate was\ninstalled people coming down\nfrom Third Avenue side (Lots 13 - 16) would\nhave to unlock a gate to get through or they would have to go all the way around\nthe\nblock, round the corner of Coode Street, out to the public footpath to get\nto the bins which would be inconvenient for people. He\nsaid in all the time he\nhas been in the property no one has commented about people wandering through\nthe place.\n\n Ms\nGatt gave evidence that she has lived on both sides of the complex as both\ntenant and owner and has never seen members of the\npublic utilising the\nlaneway as a thoroughfare. She in fact gave evidence that when she first moved\nin it took her a week to realise\nthat there was even a walkway there and she\nonly found it when she went to find the rubbish bins.\n\n Ms\nGatt also gave evidence that the walkway was not visible from the street on both\nthe Third Avenue and Coode Street sides. This\nevidence was unshaken in\ncross-examination.\n\n The\napplicant says that her lot has three open boundaries, including one along the\nwalkway all of which are exposed and all of which\npose a risk. However, she\nprovided no evidence of damage which has occurred to her property or any other\nissues which have arisen.\n\n I\nfind that the decision of the strata company not to install a gate is not\nunreasonable given the evidence I have referred to above.\n There are no\nidentified safety risks, no evidence the laneway is being used as a thoroughfare\nand the entrances to the laneway are\nnot visible outside the complex.\n\n The\nQIA Safety report is very brief, it does not expand on its recommendations or\nprovide reasons for them and further both parties\nagreed that its recommendation\nas to the location of the other gate is unclear.\n\n If\nthe gate was to be locked, I accept that this would cause significant\ninconvenience to at least some of the residents. When I\nraised this issue with\nthe applicant, she said it could be unlocked, however I find that this may\nthen not achieve the object of\npreventing public access. \n\n However,\nregardless of whether a gate is locked or unlocked, I find that the decision of\nthe strata company on this issue is not\nunreasonable.\n\nOrders\nThe Tribunal orders:\n\nThe\napplication is dismissed.\n\nI certify that the preceding paragraph(s)\ncomprise the reasons for decision of the State Administrative Tribunal.\nMS N EAGLING, MEMBER\n17 JANUARY 2025\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPrint\n\n \n\n \n \nPrint (pretty)\n \n\n \n \nPrint (eco-friendly)\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nDownload\n\n \n\n \n \nRTF format (294 KB)\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nSigned PDF/A format\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCited By\n\n \n\n \n \n LawCite records\n \n\n \n \n NoteUp references\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nJoin the discussion\n\n \n\n \n \nTweet this page\n \n\n \n \nFollow @AustLII on Twitter\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nAbout\n \n\n \n \nCopyright & Usage\n \n\n \n \nPrivacy\n \n\n \n \nDisclaimers\n \n\n \n \nHelp\n \n\n \nhttp://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/wa/WASAT/2025/5.html
