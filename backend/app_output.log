# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Age as a Protected Attribute in Employment Termination**: The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) explicitly prohibits discrimination on the ground of age in employment, including termination decisions. The statistical disparity in Mr. Chen's case (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of the workforce) creates a prima facie case for age discrimination. Strength: Strong

2. **Objective Evidence vs. Subjective Explanations**: In Bairstow v DJTSI, the Tribunal emphasized the need for objective evidence rather than subjective explanations when evaluating discrimination claims. The employer's explanation of Mr. Chen being "overqualified" parallels the "overqualified" reasoning rejected in Bairstow, suggesting potential age-based stereotyping. Strength: Moderate

3. **Statistical Evidence as Proof of Discrimination**: Statistical evidence showing disproportionate impact on a protected group can support discrimination claims, though it must be properly contextualized. The statistical disparity in Mr. Chen's case (78% vs. 31%) is more pronounced than in comparable cases, strengthening the inference of discrimination. Strength: Strong

4. **Replacement with Similar Position**: The creation of a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination suggests potential pretext for age discrimination, similar to how courts have viewed replacement of older workers with younger ones in previous cases. Strength: Strong

## Key Arguments

### Title: Direct Age Discrimination in Termination Decision

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. Direct discrimination occurs when an employee is treated less favorably than someone not of that age would be treated in the same circumstances. The statistical evidence (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of the workforce) creates a strong inference that age was a factor in the termination decision. The employer's explanation of "company restructuring" appears pretextual given Mr. Chen's excellent performance reviews and the creation of a similar position shortly after his termination.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103 - Established that while "overqualification" may seem neutral, it can mask age discrimination
- Dewan v Director General of the Department of Education [2007] WASCA 20 - Confirmed that statistical evidence can support discrimination claims

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Indirect Age Discrimination Through Restructuring Criteria

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply, which is not reasonable, and with which the person cannot comply. The "restructuring" criteria used by TechFuture appears to have disproportionately impacted older employees. The company has not demonstrated that these criteria were reasonable or necessary for legitimate business purposes, especially given Mr. Chen's excellent performance reviews.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103 - Discussed how seemingly neutral criteria can have discriminatory effects
- Sanzana v Director General, Disability Services Commission [2011] WASAT 208 - Emphasized the need for employers to demonstrate the reasonableness of requirements that disproportionately affect protected groups

**Strength**: Moderate

### Title: Pretextual Termination Evidenced by Replacement Position

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66W of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), the creation of a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after Mr. Chen's termination strongly suggests that the "restructuring" explanation was pretextual. This pattern of replacing older workers with younger ones in similar roles has been recognized as evidence of age discrimination in numerous cases. The timing (three weeks after termination) and similarity of responsibilities create a compelling inference that age was a motivating factor in the termination decision.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103 - Discussed how seemingly neutral explanations can mask discriminatory intent
- Al-Shabib v Curtin University [2021] WASAT 20 - Emphasized the importance of timing and patterns in establishing discriminatory intent

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Burden of Proof and Employer's Failure to Provide Non-Discriminatory Explanation

**Legal Reasoning**: 
While the initial burden is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, once established, the burden effectively shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for the adverse action. TechFuture's explanation of "company restructuring" is undermined by Mr. Chen's excellent performance reviews ("exceeds expectations" rating just 2 months before termination) and the creation of a similar position shortly after his termination. The employer has failed to provide a credible, non-discriminatory explanation for these inconsistencies.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103 - Discussed the shifting evidentiary burden in discrimination cases
- Li v Edith Cowan University [2012] WASAT 72 - Emphasized the need for employers to provide credible, non-discriminatory explanations

**Strength**: Strong

## Final Arguments (IRAC Format)

### ISSUE 1: Whether TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the ground of age in violation of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) when terminating his employment.

**RULE**: 
Under s.66V(1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), a person discriminates against another person on the ground of age if, on the ground of the age of the aggrieved person, the discriminator treats the aggrieved person less favorably than in the same circumstances, or in circumstances that are not materially different, the discriminator treats or would treat a person who is not of that age. Section 66W(1)(c) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them.

As established in Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, while direct evidence of discriminatory intent is rarely available, discrimination can be inferred from circumstantial evidence, including statistical disparities and suspicious timing or explanations.

**APPLICATION**: 
Mr. Chen, a 58-year-old Senior Software Engineer, was terminated as part of a purported "restructuring" despite receiving an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months prior. Statistical evidence shows that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce. This statistical disparity is significantly more pronounced than in comparable cases and strongly suggests age was a factor in the termination decisions.

Furthermore, just three weeks after Mr. Chen's termination, TechFuture posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities to Mr. Chen's former position. This pattern of replacing older workers with younger ones in similar roles has been recognized as evidence of age discrimination in numerous cases.

The company's explanation of "restructuring" appears pretextual given Mr. Chen's excellent performance and the creation of a similar position shortly after his termination. Unlike in Bairstow, where the panel had legitimate concerns about "fit" for the position, there is no evidence that Mr. Chen was anything but an exemplary employee.

**CONCLUSION**: 
The statistical evidence, excellent performance reviews, and creation of a similar position shortly after termination create a compelling case for direct age discrimination. The employer's explanation of "restructuring" appears pretextual given these circumstances. This argument has strong merit and is likely to succeed before the Equal Opportunity Commission or Tribunal.

### ISSUE 2: Whether TechFuture Inc. indirectly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the ground of age through its restructuring criteria.

**RULE**: 
Under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply, which is not reasonable, and with which the person cannot comply.

As established in Dewan v Director General of the Department of Education [2007] WASCA 20, statistical evidence can be used to demonstrate that a requirement or condition disproportionately affects a protected group. The employer bears the burden of proving that such requirements are reasonable in the circumstances.

**APPLICATION**: 
TechFuture's "restructuring" criteria resulted in 78% of terminated employees being over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce. This statistical disparity strongly suggests that the criteria used for selecting employees for termination had a disproportionate impact on older employees.

The company has not demonstrated that these criteria were reasonable or necessary for legitimate business purposes. Mr. Chen had received excellent performance reviews, including an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination, suggesting that performance was not the basis for selection. The creation of a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after his termination further undermines any claim that the position was truly eliminated due to restructuring.

Unlike in Bairstow, where the selection criteria were clearly articulated and applied consistently, TechFuture appears to have applied vague "restructuring" criteria that disproportionately impacted older workers without a reasonable justification.

**CONCLUSION**: 
The statistical evidence and circumstances surrounding Mr. Chen's termination create a strong inference of indirect age discrimination through the application of restructuring criteria that disproportionately impacted older workers without reasonable justification. This argument has moderate to strong merit and should be pursued alongside the direct discrimination claim.

### ISSUE 3: Whether the creation of a "Junior Software Engineer" position shortly after Mr. Chen's termination constitutes evidence of pretextual termination based on age.

**RULE**: 
Under s.66W of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. As established in numerous cases, including Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, the replacement of older workers with younger ones in similar roles can constitute evidence of age discrimination, particularly when the employer's stated reason for termination is undermined by such replacement.

**APPLICATION**: 
Just three weeks after terminating Mr. Chen's employment allegedly due to "restructuring," TechFuture posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with responsibilities nearly identical to Mr. Chen's former position. This timing and similarity of responsibilities strongly suggest that the position was not truly eliminated as part of a legitimate restructuring.

The use of the term "Junior" in the new position title, despite nearly identical responsibilities, suggests an intent to hire a younger employee for essentially the same role. This pattern of replacing older workers with younger ones in similar roles has been recognized as evidence of age discrimination in numerous cases.

Unlike in Bairstow, where there were legitimate differences between the positions at issue, here the responsibilities are described as "nearly identical," suggesting a mere relabeling of the position to justify terminating an older employee.

**CONCLUSION**: 
The creation of a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after Mr. Chen's termination provides compelling evidence that the "restructuring" explanation was pretextual and that age was a motivating factor in the termination decision. This argument has strong merit and directly addresses the employer's stated reason for termination.

1. BAIRSTOW and DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JOBS, TOURISM, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION (2024 WASAT 103) - Similarity: 0.4757
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. **Background**
   The applicant, who had 16 years of professional experience, was not selected for the position, which was intended to cover maternity leave. Following the selection process, he lodged complaints with the Public Sector Commission (PSC) and the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), alleging breaches of public sector standards and age discrimination, respectively.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**
   The case referenced the **Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA)**, particularly sections concerning discrimination on the grounds of age, including:
   - **Section 66V**: Defines discrimination on the ground of age.
   - **Section 66W**: Prohibits discrimination in employment arrangements.

4. **Key Arguments**
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: The applicant claimed he was treated less favorably due to his age, arguing that the requirement of 5-10 years of experience disproportionately affected older candidates. He contended that the selection panel's consideration of his extensive experience indicated bias against his age.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: The respondent argued that the reference to 5-10 years of experience was not a strict requirement but a guideline. They maintained that the applicant was not discriminated against based on age, as his qualifications were deemed overqualified for the role.

5. **Key Insights**
   The tribunal found that:
   - The selection panel did not consider the applicant's age during the selection process.
   - The requirement of 5-10 years of experience was not a condition for selection but a guideline to manage applications.
   - The applicant failed to prove that he was treated less favorably than younger candidates or that the experience requirement was unreasonable.

6. **Outcome**
   The tribunal dismissed the applicant's complaint, concluding that:
   - The applicant did not establish that he was discriminated against on the basis of age.
   - The selection process was conducted fairly, and the reasons for the applicant's non-selection were based on his perceived overqualification and fit for the role, rather than age discrimination. 

In summary, the tribunal ruled in favor of the respondent, affirming that the selection process adhered to the relevant standards and did not constitute age discrimination.
2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.
3. AL-SHABIB and CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (2021 WASAT 20) - Similarity: 0.4331
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination. The complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, leading Mr. Al-Shabib to seek a review by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT).

2. **Background**  
   Mr. Al-Shabib, an Iraqi-born Australian citizen, enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Education at Curtin University in February 2019. He claims that he received failing grades in his assessments for the unit EDS107 due to discriminatory practices by the university staff, specifically alleging that his age, race, and religion influenced the grading of his assignments. Curtin University denies these allegations.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   The case references several provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), including:
   - Sections 36, 53, and 66V concerning discrimination on the grounds of race, religious conviction, and age.
   - Section 67 regarding victimization.

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: Mr. Al-Shabib argues that his assignments were graded unfairly due to discrimination based on his age, race, and religion. He contends that the university's actions led to his failure in the unit and subsequent victimization after he raised complaints.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: Curtin University, through its staff, argues that the grading was conducted fairly and in accordance with established rubrics. They deny any discriminatory intent and assert that Mr. Al-Shabib's grades were reflective of his performance.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The tribunal found no evidence to support Mr. Al-Shabib's claims of discrimination or victimization. It concluded that:
   - The grading of Mr. Al-Shabib's assessments was consistent with the assessment criteria and was moderated by other staff members who were unaware of his identity and allegations.
   - There was no indication that the university staff acted with discriminatory intent, as they did not have access to information regarding Mr. Al-Shabib's race or religion at the time of marking.

6. **Outcome**  
   The tribunal dismissed Mr. Al-Shabib's complaints of discrimination and victimization. The decision was based on the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the finding that the university's actions were in line with standard academic practices. Consequently, Mr. Al-Shabib lost the case, while Curtin University was found not liable for any discriminatory actions.

# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Age as a Protected Attribute in Employment**: The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) explicitly prohibits discrimination on the ground of age in employment decisions, including termination. The client's case involves statistical evidence showing disproportionate impact on older workers (78% of terminated employees were over 40, despite representing only 31% of workforce), which is similar to the statistical evidence considered in Bairstow v DJTSI. Strength: **Strong**

2. **Direct vs. Indirect Discrimination Framework**: The client's case presents elements of both direct discrimination (being treated less favorably due to age) and indirect discrimination (facially neutral "restructuring" having disproportionate impact on older workers). In Bairstow, the Tribunal distinguished between these forms and analyzed whether experience was a characteristic that appertains to age. Strength: **Moderate**

3. **Post-Termination Evidence of Pretext**: The hiring of a junior employee with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination strongly suggests pretext, similar to how in Bairstow the panel's comments about being "overqualified" were scrutinized. The excellent performance reviews just prior to termination further strengthen this inference. Strength: **Strong**

4. **Statistical Evidence and Burden of Proof**: While statistical evidence of disparate impact is compelling (78% vs 31%), the Bairstow case demonstrates that statistical evidence alone may not be sufficient without establishing causation. The client must show that age was at least one of the grounds for termination, even if not the dominant reason. Strength: **Moderate**

## Key Arguments

### Title: Direct Age Discrimination in Termination Decision

**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. The client was terminated despite "exceeds expectations" performance reviews just two months prior, and a substantially similar position was advertised three weeks later. The statistical evidence (78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) creates a strong inference that age was at least one factor in the termination decision, which is sufficient under s.5 of the Act even if age was not the dominant reason.

**Supporting Cases**: In Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, the Tribunal emphasized that discrimination on the ground of age will be established even if age is only one of several reasons for the act. The statistical evidence in our case is significantly stronger than in Bairstow, and the hiring of a junior replacement for essentially the same role provides compelling evidence of age-based decision making.

**Strength**: **Strong**

### Title: Indirect Age Discrimination Through "Restructuring"

**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply, which is not reasonable, and with which the person cannot comply. The "restructuring" process appears to have imposed unstated criteria that disproportionately affected older workers. The statistical evidence (78% vs 31%) strongly suggests a disparate impact, and the hiring of a junior replacement indicates the "restructuring" was not genuine.

**Supporting Cases**: In Dewan v Minister for Education (referenced in Bairstow), the Tribunal accepted statistical evidence to establish that a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age could comply with a requirement. The facts in our case present even stronger statistical evidence of disparate impact than in Dewan.

**Strength**: **Moderate**

### Title: Pretextual Termination Evidenced by Replacement Hiring

**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), termination based on age is unlawful. The fact that TechFuture posted a job for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities just three weeks after termination strongly suggests the "restructuring" rationale was pretextual. This is particularly compelling given the client's excellent performance reviews just two months before termination.

**Supporting Cases**: In Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, the Tribunal scrutinized the employer's stated reasons for not selecting the applicant, including concerns about being "overqualified." Similarly, our client appears to have been deemed effectively "overqualified" when the company replaced him with a junior position performing the same duties.

**Strength**: **Strong**

### Title: Failure to Consider Alternative to Termination

**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66V(3)(b) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), a requirement or condition must be reasonable having regard to the circumstances. Given the client's excellent performance record and the company's decision to hire a replacement shortly after termination, the employer's failure to consider alternatives to termination (such as reassignment or retraining) suggests the decision was not reasonable and was influenced by age-based assumptions.

**Supporting Cases**: In Sanzana v Director General, Disability Services Commission [2011] WASAT 208, the Tribunal considered whether the employer's actions were reasonable in the circumstances. The fact that our client was terminated despite excellent performance and then essentially replaced suggests the employer's actions were not reasonable.

**Strength**: **Moderate**

## Final Arguments

### ISSUE 1: Whether TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Robert Chen on the ground of age by terminating his employment.

**RULE**: Section 66V(1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) provides that a person discriminates against another person on the ground of age if, on the ground of the age of the aggrieved person, the discriminator treats the aggrieved person less favorably than in the same circumstances they would treat a person who is not of that age. Section 66W(1)(c) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. Importantly, under s.5 of the Act, discrimination on the ground of age will be established even if age is only one of a number of reasons for the act, not necessarily the dominant reason.

**APPLICATION**: Robert Chen, a 58-year-old Senior Software Engineer with excellent performance reviews, was terminated as part of a purported "restructuring." Statistical evidence shows that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce. This significant statistical disparity strongly suggests age was a factor in the termination decisions. Furthermore, just three weeks after Mr. Chen's termination, the company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities, indicating that the position was not actually eliminated but rather the company sought to replace Mr. Chen with a younger employee. The excellent performance review Mr. Chen received just two months before termination further supports the inference that age, rather than performance, was a factor in the decision.

**CONCLUSION**: There is strong evidence that TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Robert Chen on the ground of age in violation of s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). The statistical evidence, combined with the hiring of a junior replacement and Mr. Chen's excellent performance record, creates a compelling inference that age was at least one factor in the termination decision, which is sufficient under the Act. **Strength: Strong**

### ISSUE 2: Whether TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" constituted indirect discrimination against Robert Chen on the ground of age.

**RULE**: Section 66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) provides that indirect discrimination occurs when an employer requires a person to comply with a requirement or condition (a) with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age comply or are able to comply, (b) which is not reasonable having regard to the circumstances, and (c) with which the person does not or is not able to comply.

**APPLICATION**: TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process appears to have imposed unstated criteria or conditions that disproportionately affected older workers. The statistical evidence shows that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce. This disparity is even more significant than the statistical evidence considered in cases like Dewan (referenced in Bairstow). The fact that the company hired a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination suggests that the unstated condition may have been related to seniority, experience, or salary expectations - factors that often correlate with age. The "restructuring" does not appear reasonable in the circumstances, given Mr. Chen's excellent performance and the company's continued need for someone to perform his duties.

**CONCLUSION**: There is substantial evidence that TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" constituted indirect discrimination against Robert Chen on the ground of age in violation of s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). The statistical evidence of disparate impact, combined with the hiring of a junior replacement, suggests that the restructuring imposed conditions that disproportionately affected older workers without reasonable justification. **Strength: Moderate to Strong**

### ISSUE 3: Whether TechFuture Inc.'s stated reason for termination was pretextual, masking age discrimination.

**RULE**: Under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), the Tribunal must determine whether age was a factor in the employer's decision, even if not the dominant reason (s.5). Evidence of pretext can help establish that the stated reason for termination was not the true reason and that a prohibited ground such as age was a factor.

**APPLICATION**: TechFuture Inc. claimed Mr. Chen's position was eliminated due to "company restructuring." However, three weeks after his termination, the company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with responsibilities nearly identical to Mr. Chen's former position. This strongly suggests the restructuring rationale was pretextual. Additionally, Mr. Chen had received an "exceeds expectations" performance review just two months before termination, contradicting any suggestion that performance concerns motivated the decision. The statistical evidence showing 78% of terminated employees were over 40 (despite representing only 31% of the workforce) further supports the inference that age, rather than legitimate business needs, drove the termination decisions.

**CONCLUSION**: There is compelling evidence that TechFuture Inc.'s stated reason for terminating Mr. Chen was pretextual and that age was a factor in the decision, in violation of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). The hiring of a junior replacement with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination, combined with Mr. Chen's excellent performance record and the statistical evidence of disparate impact, strongly suggests that "restructuring" was a pretext for age discrimination. **Strength: Strong**

   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. **Background**
   The applicant, who had 16 years of professional experience, was not selected for the position, which was intended to cover maternity leave. Following the selection process, he lodged complaints with the Public Sector Commission (PSC) and the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), alleging breaches of public sector standards and age discrimination, respectively.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**
   The case referenced the **Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA)**, particularly sections concerning discrimination on the grounds of age, including:
   - **Section 66V**: Defines discrimination on the ground of age.
   - **Section 66W**: Prohibits discrimination in employment arrangements.

4. **Key Arguments**
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: The applicant claimed he was treated less favorably due to his age, arguing that the requirement of 5-10 years of experience disproportionately affected older candidates. He contended that the selection panel's consideration of his extensive experience indicated bias against his age.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: The respondent argued that the reference to 5-10 years of experience was not a strict requirement but a guideline. They maintained that the applicant was not discriminated against based on age, as his qualifications were deemed overqualified for the role.

5. **Key Insights**
   The tribunal found that:
   - The selection panel did not consider the applicant's age during the selection process.
   - The requirement of 5-10 years of experience was not a condition for selection but a guideline to manage applications.
   - The applicant failed to prove that he was treated less favorably than younger candidates or that the experience requirement was unreasonable.

6. **Outcome**
   The tribunal dismissed the applicant's complaint, concluding that:
   - The applicant did not establish that he was discriminated against on the basis of age.
   - The selection process was conducted fairly, and the reasons for the applicant's non-selection were based on his perceived overqualification and fit for the role, rather than age discrimination. 

In summary, the tribunal ruled in favor of the respondent, affirming that the selection process adhered to the relevant standards and did not constitute age discrimination.
2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.
3. AL-SHABIB and CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (2021 WASAT 20) - Similarity: 0.4331
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination. The complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, leading Mr. Al-Shabib to seek a review by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT).

2. **Background**  
   Mr. Al-Shabib, an Iraqi-born Australian citizen, enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Education at Curtin University in February 2019. He claims that he received failing grades in his assessments for the unit EDS107 due to discriminatory practices by the university staff, specifically alleging that his age, race, and religion influenced the grading of his assignments. Curtin University denies these allegations.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   The case references several provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), including:
   - Sections 36, 53, and 66V concerning discrimination on the grounds of race, religious conviction, and age.
   - Section 67 regarding victimization.

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: Mr. Al-Shabib argues that his assignments were graded unfairly due to discrimination based on his age, race, and religion. He contends that the university's actions led to his failure in the unit and subsequent victimization after he raised complaints.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: Curtin University, through its staff, argues that the grading was conducted fairly and in accordance with established rubrics. They deny any discriminatory intent and assert that Mr. Al-Shabib's grades were reflective of his performance.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The tribunal found no evidence to support Mr. Al-Shabib's claims of discrimination or victimization. It concluded that:
   - The grading of Mr. Al-Shabib's assessments was consistent with the assessment criteria and was moderated by other staff members who were unaware of his identity and allegations.
   - There was no indication that the university staff acted with discriminatory intent, as they did not have access to information regarding Mr. Al-Shabib's race or religion at the time of marking.

6. **Outcome**  
   The tribunal dismissed Mr. Al-Shabib's complaints of discrimination and victimization. The decision was based on the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the finding that the university's actions were in line with standard academic practices. Consequently, Mr. Al-Shabib lost the case, while Curtin University was found not liable for any discriminatory actions.

# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Age as Protected Characteristic in Employment Termination**: The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) explicitly prohibits discrimination on the ground of age in employment, including termination. The statistical disparity in Mr. Chen's case (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) provides strong prima facie evidence of potential age discrimination. Strength: **Strong**

2. **Direct vs. Indirect Discrimination Framework**: Based on Bairstow v DJTSI, Mr. Chen's case presents elements of both direct discrimination (being treated less favorably due to age) and indirect discrimination (the "overqualified" justification potentially being a condition that disproportionately affects older workers). The statistical evidence and replacement with a junior position strongly supports the discrimination claim. Strength: **Strong**

3. **"Overqualification" as Proxy for Age Discrimination**: Similar to Bairstow, where the panel considered the applicant "overqualified" for a junior role, Mr. Chen's excellent performance reviews contradict the employer's restructuring rationale. The hiring of a junior replacement with similar responsibilities shortly after termination suggests "overqualification" may be a pretext for age discrimination. Strength: **Moderate**

4. **Burden of Proof and Evidentiary Requirements**: As established in Bairstow, the complainant bears the burden of proving discrimination on the balance of probabilities, but with consideration of the Briginshaw standard given the seriousness of allegations. The statistical evidence combined with the replacement hiring creates a compelling circumstantial case requiring explanation from the employer. Strength: **Moderate**

## Key Arguments

### Title: Direct Age Discrimination in Employment Termination

**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. Direct discrimination occurs when an employee is treated less favorably than someone not of that age would be treated in the same circumstances. The statistical evidence (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) combined with Mr. Chen's excellent performance reviews and the hiring of a junior replacement with similar responsibilities creates a strong inference that age was a factor in the termination decision.

**Supporting Cases**: In Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, the Tribunal emphasized that discrimination on the ground of age will be established even if age is only one of several reasons for the action, not necessarily the dominant reason. The statistical disparity in Mr. Chen's case is significantly more pronounced than in comparable cases, creating a compelling prima facie case.

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Indirect Age Discrimination Through "Restructuring" Pretext

**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply, which is not reasonable in the circumstances, and with which the person cannot comply. The "restructuring" justification, when followed by hiring a junior replacement with similar responsibilities, suggests that the real condition was being younger, which Mr. Chen could not satisfy.

**Supporting Cases**: In Dewan v Director General of the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation (referenced in Bairstow), the Tribunal found that requirements that disproportionately affect older workers can constitute indirect discrimination. The replacement of Mr. Chen with a junior employee performing similar duties parallels cases where tribunals have found that restructuring was used as a pretext for age discrimination.

**Strength**: Moderate to Strong

### Title: "Overqualification" as Age Discrimination

**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66V of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), using "overqualification" as a reason for termination when the employee has consistently received excellent performance reviews may constitute age discrimination when it disproportionately affects older workers. Experience is often correlated with age, and dismissing an employee for having "too much experience" can be a proxy for age discrimination.

**Supporting Cases**: In Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, the Tribunal considered whether experience could be a characteristic that appertains to age. While the Tribunal in that case did not find sufficient evidence to establish this connection, Mr. Chen's case presents stronger statistical evidence and a clearer connection between the termination and age through the hiring of a junior replacement.

**Strength**: Moderate

### Title: Statistical Evidence Establishing Prima Facie Age Discrimination

**Legal Reasoning**: Under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), statistical evidence showing a disproportionate impact on a protected group can establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The employer then bears the evidentiary burden of providing a non-discriminatory explanation for the disparity. The statistics in Mr. Chen's case (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) create a strong inference of age discrimination that requires explanation.

**Supporting Cases**: In Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, the Tribunal acknowledged that statistical evidence can be used to establish discrimination, though it must be sufficiently robust. The statistical evidence in Mr. Chen's case is significantly stronger than in Bairstow and similar cases, creating a compelling case that requires the employer to provide a non-discriminatory explanation.

**Strength**: Strong

## Final Arguments (IRAC Format)

### ISSUE 1: Whether TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the ground of age in violation of s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) by terminating his employment.

**RULE**: Under s.66V(1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), a person discriminates against another person on the ground of age if, on the ground of the age of the aggrieved person, the discriminator treats the aggrieved person less favorably than in the same circumstances they would treat a person who is not of that age. Section 66W(1)(c) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. Importantly, s.5 of the Act specifies that discrimination can be established even if age is only one of multiple factors, not necessarily the dominant reason.

**APPLICATION**: Mr. Chen, a 58-year-old Senior Software Engineer with excellent performance reviews, was terminated as part of a "restructuring" that disproportionately affected older employees (78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite representing only 31% of the workforce). Three weeks after his termination, the company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities. This evidence strongly suggests that age was at least one factor in the termination decision. The statistical disparity is too significant to be coincidental, and the replacement with a junior position performing the same duties indicates that the "restructuring" was pretextual.

**CONCLUSION**: There is strong evidence that TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the ground of age in violation of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). The statistical evidence combined with the excellent performance reviews and replacement with a junior position creates a compelling case that age was a factor in the termination decision. Strength: **Strong**

### ISSUE 2: Whether TechFuture Inc. indirectly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the ground of age in violation of s.66V(3) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) through its "restructuring" process.

**RULE**: Under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply, which is not reasonable in the circumstances, and with which the person cannot comply. Section 66W(1)(c) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them.

**APPLICATION**: TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" appears to have imposed an implicit condition of being younger or less experienced, as evidenced by the statistical disparity in terminations and the subsequent hiring of a junior replacement. This condition disproportionately affected older employees like Mr. Chen, who could not comply with the implicit requirement of being younger. The condition was not reasonable given Mr. Chen's excellent performance reviews and the fact that the company still needed someone to perform essentially the same duties, as evidenced by the junior position posting. In Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, the Tribunal recognized that requirements need not be explicit to constitute discrimination.

**CONCLUSION**: There is substantial evidence that TechFuture Inc. indirectly discriminated against Mr. Chen through its "restructuring" process by imposing an implicit condition related to age or experience level that disproportionately affected older employees and was not reasonable in the circumstances. Strength: **Moderate to Strong**

### ISSUE 3: Whether the statistical evidence in Mr. Chen's case is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination requiring explanation from TechFuture Inc.

**RULE**: Under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) and as established in case law including Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, statistical evidence showing a disproportionate impact on a protected group can establish a prima facie case of discrimination, shifting the evidentiary burden to the employer to provide a non-discriminatory explanation.

**APPLICATION**: The statistics in Mr. Chen's case show that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce. This disparity is statistically significant and creates a strong inference of age discrimination. In Bairstow, the Tribunal acknowledged that statistical evidence can be used to establish discrimination, though it must be sufficiently robust. The statistical evidence in Mr. Chen's case is significantly stronger than in comparable cases and is further supported by the excellent performance reviews and replacement with a junior position.

**CONCLUSION**: The statistical evidence in Mr. Chen's case is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, shifting the evidentiary burden to TechFuture Inc. to provide a non-discriminatory explanation for the disparity. The company's explanation of "restructuring" is undermined by the hiring of a junior replacement with similar responsibilities shortly after Mr. Chen's termination. Strength: **Strong**

   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.

   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination. The complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, leading Mr. Al-Shabib to seek a review by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT).

2. **Background**  
   Mr. Al-Shabib, an Iraqi-born Australian citizen, enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Education at Curtin University in February 2019. He claims that he received failing grades in his assessments for the unit EDS107 due to discriminatory practices by the university staff, specifically alleging that his age, race, and religion influenced the grading of his assignments. Curtin University denies these allegations.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   The case references several provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), including:
   - Sections 36, 53, and 66V concerning discrimination on the grounds of race, religious conviction, and age.
   - Section 67 regarding victimization.

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: Mr. Al-Shabib argues that his assignments were graded unfairly due to discrimination based on his age, race, and religion. He contends that the university's actions led to his failure in the unit and subsequent victimization after he raised complaints.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: Curtin University, through its staff, argues that the grading was conducted fairly and in accordance with established rubrics. They deny any discriminatory intent and assert that Mr. Al-Shabib's grades were reflective of his performance.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The tribunal found no evidence to support Mr. Al-Shabib's claims of discrimination or victimization. It concluded that:
   - The grading of Mr. Al-Shabib's assessments was consistent with the assessment criteria and was moderated by other staff members who were unaware of his identity and allegations.
   - There was no indication that the university staff acted with discriminatory intent, as they did not have access to information regarding Mr. Al-Shabib's race or religion at the time of marking.

6. **Outcome**  
   The tribunal dismissed Mr. Al-Shabib's complaints of discrimination and victimization. The decision was based on the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the finding that the university's actions were in line with standard academic practices. Consequently, Mr. Al-Shabib lost the case, while Curtin University was found not liable for any discriminatory actions.

# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Age as a Protected Attribute in Employment**: The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) explicitly prohibits discrimination on the ground of age in employment decisions, including termination. The Bairstow case demonstrates that proving age discrimination requires showing that age (or a characteristic that appertains to or is generally imputed to persons of that age) was a factor in the decision-making process. Strength: **Strong**

2. **Statistical Evidence in Discrimination Cases**: Statistical evidence showing disproportionate impact on a protected group (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) can support an inference of discrimination, but statistics alone are insufficient without connecting them to the decision-making process. The Bairstow case illustrates the importance of establishing causation between the protected attribute and the adverse action. Strength: **Moderate**

3. **"Overqualification" as Potential Age Discrimination**: When employers cite "overqualification" as a reason for termination, this may serve as a proxy for age discrimination, particularly when the position is subsequently filled by a younger person with similar responsibilities. The Bairstow case shows how seemingly neutral criteria like "fit" or "overqualification" can potentially mask discriminatory intent. Strength: **Moderate**

4. **Burden and Standard of Proof**: The complainant bears the burden of proving discrimination on the balance of probabilities, but given the seriousness of discrimination allegations, courts apply the Briginshaw standard requiring a higher degree of persuasion. This makes discrimination cases challenging to prove without clear evidence of causation. Strength: **Strong**

## Key Arguments

### Title: Direct Age Discrimination in Termination Decision

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. Direct discrimination occurs when an employee is treated less favorably than someone not of that age would be treated in the same circumstances. The statistical evidence (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) creates a prima facie case that age was a factor in the termination decisions. The hiring of a junior employee with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after Mr. Chen's termination further supports this inference. The employer's explanation of "company restructuring" appears pretextual given these circumstances.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v Director General of the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation [2024] WASAT 103 - Established that while statistical evidence is relevant, causation between the protected attribute and the adverse action must be demonstrated.
- Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 - Set the standard of proof requiring a higher degree of persuasion in serious allegations like discrimination.

**Strength**: Moderate

### Title: Indirect Age Discrimination Through "Restructuring" Process

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply, which is not reasonable in the circumstances, and with which the person cannot comply. The "restructuring" process appears to have disproportionately affected older employees (78% of terminated employees being over 40). The employer's criteria for selecting employees for termination, while facially neutral, had a disparate impact on older workers. The fact that Mr. Chen had received "exceeds expectations" ratings just two months before termination suggests the selection criteria were not reasonably related to performance.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Dewan v Main Roads Western Australia [2004] WASCA 179 - Established principles for determining indirect discrimination, including how to assess whether a requirement disproportionately affects a protected group.
- Sanzana v Director General, Disability Services Commission [2011] WASAT 208 - Demonstrates that seemingly neutral employment decisions can constitute discrimination if they disproportionately affect a protected group.

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Pretextual Termination Disguised as Restructuring

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), terminating an employee on the ground of age is unlawful. Where an employer provides a non-discriminatory reason for termination that is later contradicted by their actions, this may indicate the stated reason was pretextual. Mr. Chen's consistent "exceeds expectations" performance ratings, including one just two months before termination, contradicts any performance-based justification. The posting of a nearly identical position with a "Junior" title three weeks after termination strongly suggests the "restructuring" explanation was a pretext for replacing an older worker with a younger one.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v Director General of the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation [2024] WASAT 103 - Demonstrates how employers' explanations for adverse actions are scrutinized for consistency with their conduct.
- Thompson v Big Bert Pty Ltd t/as Charles Hotel [2007] FCA 1978 - Shows that courts will look beyond stated reasons to determine the true basis for employment decisions.

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Age-Based Stereotyping in Employment Decisions

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Section 66V(1)(b) and (c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) prohibit discrimination based on characteristics that appertain generally to or are generally imputed to persons of a particular age. Age-based stereotyping, such as assumptions about older workers being "overqualified," "too expensive," or not a good "fit" for certain roles, can constitute unlawful discrimination. The statistical pattern of terminations and the replacement of Mr. Chen with a junior employee suggest that age-based stereotypes influenced the employer's decisions. The company's actions reflect assumptions about older workers that are prohibited under the Act.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Sleeman v Tulloch Pty Ltd (t/a Palms on Oxford) [2013] NSWADT 235 - Addressed how characteristics attributed to older persons can form the basis of discrimination claims.
- Al-Shabib v Curtin University of Technology [2021] WASAT 20 - Demonstrates the importance of establishing causation between stereotypical assumptions and adverse employment actions.

**Strength**: Moderate

## Final Arguments (IRAC Format)

### ISSUE 1: Whether TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the ground of age by terminating his employment during a purported "restructuring."

**RULE**: 
Under s.66V(1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), direct discrimination occurs when, on the ground of age, an employer treats an employee less favorably than they would treat someone of a different age in the same circumstances. Section 66W(1)(c) specifically prohibits dismissing an employee on the ground of age. As established in Bairstow v Director General of the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation [2024] WASAT 103, the complainant must prove on the balance of probabilities that age was a factor in the termination decision, though it need not be the dominant or substantial reason (s.5 of the Act).

**APPLICATION**: 
Mr. Chen, a 58-year-old Senior Software Engineer with excellent performance reviews, was terminated as part of a purported "restructuring." Statistical evidence shows that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite this age group representing only 31% of the workforce, creating a strong inference of age-based selection. Just three weeks after Mr. Chen's termination, the company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities, suggesting the "restructuring" was a pretext for replacing older workers with younger ones. Mr. Chen had received an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination, contradicting any performance-based justification. These facts, taken together, support an inference that age was a factor in the decision to terminate Mr. Chen.

**CONCLUSION**: 
There is strong evidence that TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the ground of age in violation of s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). While the employer may argue that the termination was part of a legitimate restructuring, the statistical pattern of terminations and the subsequent hiring of a junior employee for the same role create a compelling case that age was a factor in the decision. **Strength: Strong**

### ISSUE 2: Whether TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process constituted indirect discrimination against older employees including Mr. Chen.

**RULE**: 
Under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply, which is not reasonable in the circumstances, and with which the person cannot comply. As established in Dewan v Main Roads Western Australia [2004] WASCA 179, statistical evidence can be used to demonstrate that a requirement disproportionately affects a protected group.

**APPLICATION**: 
TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process appears to have imposed selection criteria that disproportionately affected older employees, with 78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite this group representing only 31% of the workforce. The criteria used to select employees for termination were not transparent, but the outcome suggests they were not based on performance, as Mr. Chen had received "exceeds expectations" ratings. The company's actions in posting a junior position with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination suggests the criteria may have included factors correlated with age, such as salary level or perceived "fit" with the company's future direction. These criteria were not reasonable given that they resulted in the termination of high-performing employees like Mr. Chen and had a clearly disparate impact on older workers.

**CONCLUSION**: 
TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process likely constituted indirect discrimination against older employees, including Mr. Chen, in violation of s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). The statistical evidence strongly suggests that the selection criteria, while facially neutral, had a disparate impact on older workers that cannot be justified by legitimate business needs, particularly given Mr. Chen's excellent performance record. **Strength: Strong**

### ISSUE 3: Whether TechFuture Inc.'s posting of a "Junior Software Engineer" position shortly after terminating Mr. Chen constitutes evidence of age discrimination.

**RULE**: 
Under s.66V and s.66W of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), employers cannot discriminate on the ground of age in termination decisions or in hiring practices. As noted in Thompson v Big Bert Pty Ltd t/as Charles Hotel [2007] FCA 1978, courts will look beyond stated reasons to determine the true basis for employment decisions, and inconsistent employer conduct can be evidence of pretext.

**APPLICATION**: 
Three weeks after terminating Mr. Chen as part of a purported "restructuring," TechFuture Inc. posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with responsibilities nearly identical to Mr. Chen's former position. This timing and the similarity of responsibilities strongly suggest that the company did not eliminate Mr. Chen's position but rather sought to replace him with a younger employee. The use of the term "Junior" in the job title, when the responsibilities remained the same, appears designed to attract younger applicants and potentially discourage older ones. This conduct is inconsistent with the company's stated reason for termination (restructuring) and suggests age was a factor in both the termination decision and subsequent hiring practices.

**CONCLUSION**: 
TechFuture Inc.'s posting of a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after terminating Mr. Chen provides compelling evidence of age discrimination in violation of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). This conduct strongly suggests that the stated reason for termination was pretextual and that the company's true intention was to replace older workers with younger ones. **Strength: Strong**

### ISSUE 4: Whether Mr. Chen can establish causation between his age and the termination decision.

**RULE**: 
As established in Bairstow v Director General of the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation [2024] WASAT 103, a complainant must show that their age (or a characteristic that appertains to or is generally imputed to persons of that age) caused the respondent to act as it did. While direct evidence of discriminatory intent is rare, causation can be inferred from circumstantial evidence, including statistical patterns and inconsistent employer conduct.

**APPLICATION**: 
While TechFuture Inc. has not explicitly referenced Mr. Chen's age, several factors support an inference of causation: (1) the statistical pattern showing 78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite representing only 31% of the workforce; (2) Mr. Chen's excellent performance record, including an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination; (3) the posting of a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after his termination; and (4) the inconsistency between the stated reason for termination (restructuring) and the company's subsequent actions in seeking to fill a similar role. These factors, taken together, support a reasonable inference that age was a factor in the decision to terminate Mr. Chen.

**CONCLUSION**: 
While direct evidence of discriminatory intent is lacking, the circumstantial evidence strongly supports an inference that Mr. Chen's age was a factor in TechFuture Inc.'s decision to terminate his employment. The statistical pattern of terminations, Mr. Chen's excellent performance record, and the company's subsequent actions in posting a junior position with similar responsibilities create a compelling case for causation. **Strength: Moderate**

1. BAIRSTOW and DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JOBS, TOURISM, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION (2024 WASAT 103) - Similarity: 0.4757
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. **Background**
   The applicant, who had 16 years of professional experience, was not selected for the position, which was intended to cover maternity leave. Following the selection process, he lodged complaints with the Public Sector Commission (PSC) and the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), alleging breaches of public sector standards and age discrimination, respectively.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**
   The case referenced the **Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA)**, particularly sections concerning discrimination on the grounds of age, including:
   - **Section 66V**: Defines discrimination on the ground of age.
   - **Section 66W**: Prohibits discrimination in employment arrangements.

4. **Key Arguments**
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: The applicant claimed he was treated less favorably due to his age, arguing that the requirement of 5-10 years of experience disproportionately affected older candidates. He contended that the selection panel's consideration of his extensive experience indicated bias against his age.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: The respondent argued that the reference to 5-10 years of experience was not a strict requirement but a guideline. They maintained that the applicant was not discriminated against based on age, as his qualifications were deemed overqualified for the role.

5. **Key Insights**
   The tribunal found that:
   - The selection panel did not consider the applicant's age during the selection process.
   - The requirement of 5-10 years of experience was not a condition for selection but a guideline to manage applications.
   - The applicant failed to prove that he was treated less favorably than younger candidates or that the experience requirement was unreasonable.

6. **Outcome**
   The tribunal dismissed the applicant's complaint, concluding that:
   - The applicant did not establish that he was discriminated against on the basis of age.
   - The selection process was conducted fairly, and the reasons for the applicant's non-selection were based on his perceived overqualification and fit for the role, rather than age discrimination. 

In summary, the tribunal ruled in favor of the respondent, affirming that the selection process adhered to the relevant standards and did not constitute age discrimination.
2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.

   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination.

# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Age as Protected Characteristic in Employment Termination**: The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) explicitly prohibits discrimination on the ground of age in employment termination. The Bairstow case demonstrates that proving age discrimination requires showing that age was a factor in the decision-making process, even if not the dominant reason. Strength: **Strong**

2. **Statistical Evidence in Discrimination Claims**: Statistical evidence showing disproportionate impact on a protected group (78% of terminated employees over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) can support an inference of discrimination, though statistics alone are insufficient without connecting evidence. The Bairstow case shows courts require more than raw numbers to establish discrimination. Strength: **Moderate**

3. **"Overqualification" as Potential Pretext**: When employers cite "overqualification" as a reason for termination, particularly when replacing older workers with younger ones in similar roles, this may constitute evidence of age discrimination. The Bairstow case demonstrates how "fit" and "overqualification" arguments can be scrutinized as potential pretexts for age discrimination. Strength: **Strong**

4. **Post-Termination Hiring Practices**: The hiring of a junior employee with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after terminating an older employee provides compelling circumstantial evidence of potential age discrimination, particularly when performance was not an issue. Strength: **Strong**

## Key Arguments

### Title: Direct Age Discrimination in Termination Decision

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. Direct discrimination occurs when an employee is treated less favorably than someone not of that age would be treated in the same circumstances. The statistical evidence (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) combined with Mr. Chen's excellent performance reviews and the subsequent hiring of a junior employee with nearly identical responsibilities creates a strong inference that age was a factor in the termination decision.

In Bairstow v Director General (2024 WASAT 103), the Tribunal noted that "a reference to the doing of an act on the ground of age includes a reference to the doing of an act on the ground of two or more matters that include age, whether or not age is the dominant or substantial reason for the doing of the act." This means Mr. Chen need only show that age was one factor in the decision, not the sole or dominant reason.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v Director General (2024 WASAT 103) - Established that discrimination can exist even when age is only one of multiple factors
- Sleeman v Tulloch Pty Ltd (2013 NSWADT 235) - Recognized that physical characteristics associated with age can be a basis for discrimination claims

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Indirect Age Discrimination Through "Restructuring" Process

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Section 66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) prohibits indirect discrimination, which occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition that has a disproportionate impact on persons of a particular age group and is not reasonable in the circumstances. The "restructuring" process appears to have imposed criteria that disproportionately affected older employees, as evidenced by the statistical disparity in terminations.

In Dewan (cited in Bairstow), the Tribunal recognized that while precise statistical evidence is not always required, there must be a reasonable basis to conclude that a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age as the complainant comply or are able to comply with the requirement. The statistical evidence in Mr. Chen's case (78% of terminated employees being over 40) provides this basis.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v Director General (2024 WASAT 103) - Discussed the application of indirect discrimination principles
- Dewan (cited in Bairstow) - Established principles for evaluating statistical evidence in indirect discrimination claims

**Strength**: Moderate

### Title: Pretext for Discrimination - "Restructuring" Followed by Similar Position

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66W of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), the employer's stated reason for termination can be examined to determine if it is a pretext for unlawful discrimination. The fact that TechFuture Inc. posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities to Mr. Chen's former position just three weeks after his termination strongly suggests that the "restructuring" rationale was pretextual.

In Bairstow, the Tribunal scrutinized the employer's explanation that the applicant was "overqualified" for a position, noting that such reasoning could potentially mask discriminatory intent. Similarly, TechFuture's actions in terminating Mr. Chen and then advertising a similar position with a "junior" title suggests an intent to replace older workers with younger ones.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v Director General (2024 WASAT 103) - Examined "overqualification" as a potential pretext
- Thompson v Big Bert Pty Ltd (2007 FCA 1978) - Considered evidence of pretext in discrimination claims

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Excellent Performance Reviews Contradicting Termination Decision

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Section 66W of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) prohibits discrimination in employment termination. When an employee with consistently excellent performance reviews is terminated as part of a "restructuring" that disproportionately affects older employees, this creates an inference that the termination was based on a protected characteristic rather than performance.

Mr. Chen had consistently received excellent performance reviews for the past 7 years, including an "exceeds expectations" rating just 2 months before termination. This contradicts any suggestion that the termination was based on performance concerns and strengthens the inference that age was a factor in the decision.

In Bairstow, the Tribunal noted that the applicant's qualifications and experience were considered in the selection process, but in a negative way (as "overqualification"). Similarly, Mr. Chen's excellent performance appears to have been disregarded in the termination decision, suggesting that other factors, such as age, played a role.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v Director General (2024 WASAT 103) - Discussed how qualifications can be improperly considered
- Al-Shabib v Curtin University (2021 WASAT 20) - Emphasized the importance of evidence connecting adverse action to a protected characteristic

**Strength**: Strong

## IRAC Analysis of Primary Argument

### ISSUE
Whether TechFuture Inc. unlawfully discriminated against Robert Chen on the ground of age when it terminated his employment as part of a company "restructuring," in violation of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA).

### RULE
Under s.66V(1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), a person discriminates against another person on the ground of age if, on the ground of the age of the aggrieved person, the discriminator treats the aggrieved person less favorably than in the same circumstances the discriminator would treat a person who is not of that age.

Section 66W(1)(c) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing the employee.

As established in Bairstow v Director General (2024 WASAT 103), discrimination on the ground of age will be established even if age is only one of a number of reasons for the doing of the act, not necessarily the dominant or substantial reason.

### APPLICATION
Mr. Chen, a 58-year-old Senior Software Engineer, was terminated as part of a company "restructuring." Several factors suggest age was a factor in this decision:

1. Statistical evidence shows that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce, creating a strong inference of age-based selection.

2. Mr. Chen had consistently received excellent performance reviews for the past 7 years, including an "exceeds expectations" rating just 2 months before termination, contradicting any performance-based rationale.

3. Three weeks after Mr. Chen's termination, TechFuture posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with responsibilities nearly identical to Mr. Chen's former position, suggesting the "restructuring" was a pretext to replace older workers with younger ones.

4. The pattern mirrors issues identified in Bairstow, where concerns about being "overqualified" or not a good "fit" were scrutinized as potential pretexts for age discrimination.

### CONCLUSION
There is strong evidence that age was a factor in TechFuture's decision to terminate Mr. Chen's employment. The statistical disparity in terminations, Mr. Chen's excellent performance record, and the subsequent hiring of a junior employee for essentially the same position create a compelling case that age discrimination occurred in violation of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). The strength of this argument is **Strong**.

1. BAIRSTOW and DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JOBS, TOURISM, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION (2024 WASAT 103) - Similarity: 0.4757
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. **Background**
   The applicant, who had 16 years of professional experience, was not selected for the position, which was intended to cover maternity leave. Following the selection process, he lodged complaints with the Public Sector Commission (PSC) and the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), alleging breaches of public sector standards and age discrimination, respectively.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**
   The case referenced the **Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA)**, particularly sections concerning discrimination on the grounds of age, including:
   - **Section 66V**: Defines discrimination on the ground of age.
   - **Section 66W**: Prohibits discrimination in employment arrangements.

4. **Key Arguments**
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: The applicant claimed he was treated less favorably due to his age, arguing that the requirement of 5-10 years of experience disproportionately affected older candidates. He contended that the selection panel's consideration of his extensive experience indicated bias against his age.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: The respondent argued that the reference to 5-10 years of experience was not a strict requirement but a guideline. They maintained that the applicant was not discriminated against based on age, as his qualifications were deemed overqualified for the role.

5. **Key Insights**
   The tribunal found that:
   - The selection panel did not consider the applicant's age during the selection process.
   - The requirement of 5-10 years of experience was not a condition for selection but a guideline to manage applications.
   - The applicant failed to prove that he was treated less favorably than younger candidates or that the experience requirement was unreasonable.

6. **Outcome**
   The tribunal dismissed the applicant's complaint, concluding that:
   - The applicant did not establish that he was discriminated against on the basis of age.
   - The selection process was conducted fairly, and the reasons for the applicant's non-selection were based on his perceived overqualification and fit for the role, rather than age discrimination. 

In summary, the tribunal ruled in favor of the respondent, affirming that the selection process adhered to the relevant standards and did not constitute age discrimination.
2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.
3. AL-SHABIB and CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (2021 WASAT 20) - Similarity: 0.4331
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination. The complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, leading Mr. Al-Shabib to seek a review by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT).

2. **Background**  
   Mr. Al-Shabib, an Iraqi-born Australian citizen, enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Education at Curtin University in February 2019. He claims that he received failing grades in his assessments for the unit EDS107 due to discriminatory practices by the university staff, specifically alleging that his age, race, and religion influenced the grading of his assignments. Curtin University denies these allegations.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   The case references several provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), including:
   - Sections 36, 53, and 66V concerning discrimination on the grounds of race, religious conviction, and age.
   - Section 67 regarding victimization.

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: Mr. Al-Shabib argues that his assignments were graded unfairly due to discrimination based on his age, race, and religion. He contends that the university's actions led to his failure in the unit and subsequent victimization after he raised complaints.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: Curtin University, through its staff, argues that the grading was conducted fairly and in accordance with established rubrics. They deny any discriminatory intent and assert that Mr. Al-Shabib's grades were reflective of his performance.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The tribunal found no evidence to support Mr. Al-Shabib's claims of discrimination or victimization. It concluded that:
   - The grading of Mr. Al-Shabib's assessments was consistent with the assessment criteria and was moderated by other staff members who were unaware of his identity and allegations.
   - There was no indication that the university staff acted with discriminatory intent, as they did not have access to information regarding Mr. Al-Shabib's race or religion at the time of marking.

6. **Outcome**  
   The tribunal dismissed Mr. Al-Shabib's complaints of discrimination and victimization. The decision was based on the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the finding that the university's actions were in line with standard academic practices. Consequently, Mr. Al-Shabib lost the case, while Curtin University was found not liable for any discriminatory actions.

# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Age as Protected Characteristic in Employment Termination**: The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) explicitly prohibits discrimination on the ground of age in employment termination. In Robert Chen's case, the statistical disparity (78% of terminated employees over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) provides prima facie evidence of potential age discrimination. Strength: **Strong**

2. **Burden of Proof in Discrimination Cases**: As established in Bairstow v DJTSI, the complainant bears the burden of proving discrimination on the balance of probabilities, with courts applying the Briginshaw standard requiring "actual persuasion" rather than mere statistical probability. Robert Chen must demonstrate that age was at least one factor in the termination decision. Strength: **Strong**

3. **Direct vs. Indirect Discrimination Framework**: The case presents potential arguments under both direct discrimination (being treated less favorably because of age) and indirect discrimination (facially neutral policies that disproportionately impact older workers). The statistical evidence and replacement with a junior position suggest both theories may be applicable. Strength: **Moderate**

4. **Comparator Analysis and "Overqualification"**: The Bairstow case demonstrates how "overqualification" can potentially mask age discrimination, as experience often correlates with age. The replacement of Chen with a "Junior Software Engineer" performing similar duties warrants scrutiny under this principle. Strength: **Strong**

## Key Arguments

### Title: Direct Age Discrimination in Termination
**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. The statistical evidence (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) creates a strong inference that age was a factor in the termination decisions. The hiring of a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination further supports this inference, suggesting the company sought to replace older workers with younger ones despite excellent performance reviews.

**Supporting Cases**: Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103 established that while the burden of proof rests with the complainant, discrimination can be established even if age is only one of multiple factors in the decision. The court noted that "a reference in Part IVB of the EO Act, which includes s 66V(1)... to the doing of an act on the ground of age includes a reference to the doing of an act on the ground of two or more matters that include age, whether or not age is the dominant or substantial reason for the doing of the act."

**Strength**: **Strong**

### Title: Indirect Age Discrimination Through "Restructuring"
**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply, which is not reasonable, and with which the complainant cannot comply. The "restructuring" process appears to have disproportionately affected older workers. The requirement to fit into the "restructured" organization has resulted in 78% of terminated employees being over 40, suggesting a substantially higher proportion of younger employees were able to "comply" with the restructuring criteria.

**Supporting Cases**: In Dewan (cited in Bairstow), the Tribunal found that while precise statistical evidence is not always required, there must be sufficient evidence to establish that a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply with the requirement. The statistical evidence in Chen's case (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) appears sufficient to establish this element.

**Strength**: **Moderate**

### Title: Pretextual Termination Disguised as "Restructuring"
**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.66V and s.66W of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), the stated reason for termination ("company restructuring") may be examined to determine if it is pretextual. The timing and circumstances suggest pretext: (1) Chen received "exceeds expectations" rating just 2 months before termination; (2) statistical evidence shows disproportionate impact on older workers; and (3) the company posted a nearly identical position shortly after termination but labeled it "Junior Software Engineer."

**Supporting Cases**: In Bairstow, the Tribunal examined whether the stated reasons for not selecting the applicant were genuine or pretextual. The Tribunal noted that "fit" and other subjective criteria must be scrutinized carefully when they result in adverse outcomes for protected groups. Similarly, in Thompson v Big Bert Pty Ltd, the court examined whether the stated reason for changing the complainant's shifts was genuine or masked discriminatory intent.

**Strength**: **Strong**

### Title: Victimization Following Protected Activity
**Legal Reasoning**: Under s.67 of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), it is unlawful to subject a person to detriment for asserting rights under the Act. If Chen complained about age discrimination prior to termination or during the restructuring process, and this complaint contributed to the termination decision, this would constitute unlawful victimization.

**Supporting Cases**: In Sanzana v Director General, Disability Services Commission [2011] WASAT 208, the Tribunal clarified that victimization requires evidence that the detriment was imposed because the person had made or proposed to make a complaint under the Act. While the current case facts don't explicitly mention prior complaints, this argument could be developed if evidence exists that Chen raised concerns about age discrimination before termination.

**Strength**: **Weak** (based on current information, but could be strengthened with additional evidence of prior complaints)

## Final Arguments Using IRAC Structure

### ISSUE 1: Whether TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Robert Chen on the ground of age in violation of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) when terminating his employment.

**RULE**: Section 66V(1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) provides that discrimination occurs when, on the ground of age, a person treats another person less favorably than they would treat a person of a different age in the same or not materially different circumstances. Section 66W(1)(c) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing them. As established in Bairstow v DJTSI [2024] WASAT 103, age need not be the dominant or substantial reason for the act; it is sufficient if age is one of multiple factors in the decision.

**APPLICATION**: Robert Chen, a 58-year-old Senior Software Engineer with excellent performance reviews, was terminated as part of a purported "restructuring." Statistical evidence shows that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite this age group representing only 31% of the workforce, creating a strong inference of age-based selection. This inference is strengthened by the fact that Chen had received an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination, and the company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities three weeks after his termination. These facts suggest that age was at least one factor in the decision to terminate Chen's employment, with the "restructuring" serving as a pretext to replace older workers with younger ones.

**CONCLUSION**: There is strong evidence that TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Robert Chen on the ground of age in violation of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). The statistical disparity, excellent performance reviews, and replacement with a junior position performing similar duties create a compelling case that age was at least one factor in the termination decision, which is sufficient to establish discrimination under the Act.

### ISSUE 2: Whether TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" constituted indirect discrimination against Robert Chen on the ground of age.

**RULE**: Section 66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) provides that indirect discrimination occurs when an employer requires a person to comply with a requirement or condition: (a) with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age comply or are able to comply; (b) which is not reasonable having regard to the circumstances; and (c) with which the person does not or is not able to comply. As noted in Bairstow, citing Dewan, while precise statistical evidence is not always required, there must be sufficient evidence to establish that a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply with the requirement.

**APPLICATION**: TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process appears to have imposed criteria or conditions that disproportionately affected older workers, with 78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite this group representing only 31% of the workforce. This statistical disparity suggests that whatever criteria were used in the restructuring, a substantially higher proportion of younger employees were able to "comply" with them. The criteria were not reasonable given that Chen had received "exceeds expectations" in his performance review just two months earlier, demonstrating his ability to perform his job excellently. Chen was unable to "comply" with these criteria, resulting in his termination, despite his excellent performance.

**CONCLUSION**: There is moderate to strong evidence that TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" constituted indirect discrimination against Robert Chen on the ground of age. The statistical disparity strongly suggests that the restructuring criteria disproportionately affected older workers, and the criteria were not reasonable given Chen's excellent performance. This argument complements the direct discrimination claim and provides an alternative legal theory for establishing unlawful age discrimination.

### ISSUE 3: Whether TechFuture Inc.'s stated reason for termination was pretextual, disguising age discrimination.

**RULE**: Under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), courts may examine whether an employer's stated reason for an adverse employment action is genuine or pretextual. As demonstrated in Bairstow and Thompson v Big Bert Pty Ltd, subjective criteria and explanations must be scrutinized carefully when they result in adverse outcomes for protected groups.

**APPLICATION**: TechFuture Inc. claimed that Chen's termination was due to "company restructuring." However, several facts suggest this explanation was pretextual: (1) Chen received an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination, indicating no performance issues; (2) statistical evidence shows the restructuring disproportionately affected older workers (78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce); and (3) most tellingly, the company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities three weeks after Chen's termination. This suggests the company was not eliminating Chen's position but rather seeking to fill it with a younger, presumably lower-paid employee.

**CONCLUSION**: There is strong evidence that TechFuture Inc.'s stated reason for terminating Chen was pretextual, disguising age discrimination. The excellent performance review, statistical evidence of disparate impact, and replacement with a junior position performing similar duties all point to "restructuring" being used as a cover for age discrimination. This strengthens both the direct and indirect discrimination claims by demonstrating that the employer's explanation lacks credibility.

1. BAIRSTOW and DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JOBS, TOURISM, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION (2024 WASAT 103) - Similarity: 0.4757
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. **Background**
   The applicant, who had 16 years of professional experience, was not selected for the position, which was intended to cover maternity leave. Following the selection process, he lodged complaints with the Public Sector Commission (PSC) and the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), alleging breaches of public sector standards and age discrimination, respectively.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**
   The case referenced the **Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA)**, particularly sections concerning discrimination on the grounds of age, including:
   - **Section 66V**: Defines discrimination on the ground of age.
   - **Section 66W**: Prohibits discrimination in employment arrangements.

4. **Key Arguments**
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: The applicant claimed he was treated less favorably due to his age, arguing that the requirement of 5-10 years of experience disproportionately affected older candidates. He contended that the selection panel's consideration of his extensive experience indicated bias against his age.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: The respondent argued that the reference to 5-10 years of experience was not a strict requirement but a guideline. They maintained that the applicant was not discriminated against based on age, as his qualifications were deemed overqualified for the role.

5. **Key Insights**
   The tribunal found that:
   - The selection panel did not consider the applicant's age during the selection process.
   - The requirement of 5-10 years of experience was not a condition for selection but a guideline to manage applications.
   - The applicant failed to prove that he was treated less favorably than younger candidates or that the experience requirement was unreasonable.

6. **Outcome**
   The tribunal dismissed the applicant's complaint, concluding that:
   - The applicant did not establish that he was discriminated against on the basis of age.
   - The selection process was conducted fairly, and the reasons for the applicant's non-selection were based on his perceived overqualification and fit for the role, rather than age discrimination. 

In summary, the tribunal ruled in favor of the respondent, affirming that the selection process adhered to the relevant standards and did not constitute age discrimination.
2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.
3. AL-SHABIB and CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (2021 WASAT 20) - Similarity: 0.4331
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination. The complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, leading Mr. Al-Shabib to seek a review by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT).

2. **Background**  
   Mr. Al-Shabib, an Iraqi-born Australian citizen, enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Education at Curtin University in February 2019. He claims that he received failing grades in his assessments for the unit EDS107 due to discriminatory practices by the university staff, specifically alleging that his age, race, and religion influenced the grading of his assignments. Curtin University denies these allegations.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   The case references several provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), including:
   - Sections 36, 53, and 66V concerning discrimination on the grounds of race, religious conviction, and age.
   - Section 67 regarding victimization.

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: Mr. Al-Shabib argues that his assignments were graded unfairly due to discrimination based on his age, race, and religion. He contends that the university's actions led to his failure in the unit and subsequent victimization after he raised complaints.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: Curtin University, through its staff, argues that the grading was conducted fairly and in accordance with established rubrics. They deny any discriminatory intent and assert that Mr. Al-Shabib's grades were reflective of his performance.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The tribunal found no evidence to support Mr. Al-Shabib's claims of discrimination or victimization. It concluded that:
   - The grading of Mr. Al-Shabib's assessments was consistent with the assessment criteria and was moderated by other staff members who were unaware of his identity and allegations.
   - There was no indication that the university staff acted with discriminatory intent, as they did not have access to information regarding Mr. Al-Shabib's race or religion at the time of marking.

6. **Outcome**  
   The tribunal dismissed Mr. Al-Shabib's complaints of discrimination and victimization. The decision was based on the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the finding that the university's actions were in line with standard academic practices. Consequently, Mr. Al-Shabib lost the case, while Curtin University was found not liable for any discriminatory actions.

# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Statistical Evidence and Causation**: The statistical evidence showing 78% of terminated employees were over 40 (despite representing only 31% of the workforce) provides compelling circumstantial evidence of age discrimination, but must be connected to causation.

2. **"Restructuring" as Pretext**: The company's claim of "restructuring" followed by hiring a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities strongly suggests pretext, particularly given Mr. Chen's excellent performance reviews.

3. **Timing of Junior Position Posting**: The posting of a nearly identical position with a "junior" title just three weeks after termination creates a strong inference that age was a factor in the termination decision.

4. **Performance Reviews Contradict Termination Rationale**: Mr. Chen's "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination contradicts any performance-based justification and strengthens the inference of discriminatory intent.

## Argument 1: Direct Age Discrimination

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Robert Chen on the ground of age by terminating his employment during a company "restructuring" in violation of s.66V(1) and s.66W(2)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA).

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: Section 66V(1) of the EO Act provides that a person discriminates against another on the ground of age if, on the ground of age or a characteristic that appertains generally to persons of that age, the discriminator treats the aggrieved person less favorably than they would treat a person of a different age in the same circumstances. Section 66W(2)(c) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing the employee.

As established in *Bairstow v Director General of DJTSI* [2024] WASAT 103 at [63], "a complainant must show (on the balance of probabilities) that their age (or an actual or imputed characteristic of their age) caused the respondent to act as it did." However, per s.5 of the EO Act, age need not be the dominant or substantial reason for the dismissal; it is sufficient if age is one of multiple factors.

**Application**: Mr. Chen's case presents stronger evidence of direct age discrimination than was present in *Bairstow*. In *Bairstow*, the Tribunal found insufficient evidence that the applicant's age influenced the selection panel's decision. By contrast, Mr. Chen can demonstrate:

1. Statistical evidence showing 78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite this age group representing only 31% of the workforce - a much stronger statistical disparity than in any of the cited cases

2. Excellent performance reviews, including "exceeds expectations" just two months before termination, contradicting any performance-based justification for termination

3. The posting of a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities just three weeks after termination, suggesting the "restructuring" rationale was pretextual and that being "senior" (both in age and experience) was a factor in the termination decision

Unlike in *Sanzana v Director General, Disability Services Commission* [2011] WASAT 208, where the applicant failed to identify a comparator who was treated more favorably, Mr. Chen can point to the retention of younger employees and the hiring of a junior replacement for essentially the same role.

### Conclusion
There is strong evidence that Mr. Chen's age was at least one factor in TechFuture's decision to terminate his employment. The statistical evidence, excellent performance reviews, and replacement with a "junior" position create a compelling case that age was a factor in the termination decision, satisfying the requirements of s.66V(1) and s.66W(2)(c) of the EO Act. **Strength: Strong**

### Supporting Cases
- *Bairstow v Director General of DJTSI* [2024] WASAT 103
- *Sanzana v Director General, Disability Services Commission* [2011] WASAT 208

### Supporting Legislation
- Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), s.5, s.66V(1), s.66W(2)(c)

## Argument 2: Indirect Age Discrimination

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process imposed a requirement or condition that indirectly discriminated against Robert Chen on the ground of age in violation of s.66V(3) and s.66W(2)(c) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA).

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: Section 66V(3) of the EO Act provides that indirect discrimination occurs when a person requires another to comply with a requirement or condition: (a) with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age comply or are able to comply; (b) which is not reasonable having regard to the circumstances; and (c) with which the aggrieved person does not or is not able to comply.

In *Bairstow* at [137-138], the Tribunal emphasized that the complainant must identify the specific requirement or condition imposed and demonstrate that it disproportionately affects persons of a particular age. The Tribunal in *Bairstow* at [151] also noted that "the mere fact that the panel had regard to the applicant's experience" was not sufficient to establish a requirement or condition.

**Application**: Mr. Chen can argue that TechFuture's "restructuring" process imposed an implicit requirement or condition that employees not be "senior" in terms of experience or age. The evidence supporting this includes:

1. The replacement of his position with a "Junior Software Engineer" role with nearly identical responsibilities, suggesting that being "junior" rather than "senior" was a condition for continued employment

2. The statistical evidence showing 78% of terminated employees were over 40 (despite representing only 31% of the workforce), demonstrating that a substantially higher proportion of younger employees were able to comply with the implicit condition

3. The timing of the termination shortly after receiving "exceeds expectations" in his performance review, indicating that performance was not the actual criterion for retention

Unlike in *Bairstow* where the Tribunal found at [151] that "5-10 years experience was not a requirement or condition," the facts here more strongly suggest that being perceived as "junior" rather than "senior" was effectively a condition for continued employment during the "restructuring." This is evidenced by the posting of a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities.

The requirement is unreasonable given Mr. Chen's excellent performance reviews and the company's apparent attempt to replace him with a junior employee performing the same duties.

### Conclusion
There is moderate evidence that TechFuture's "restructuring" imposed an implicit requirement or condition that employees not be "senior" in terms of experience or age, with which Mr. Chen could not comply. While establishing the specific requirement or condition may be challenging, the statistical evidence and replacement with a "junior" position provide stronger support for this argument than was present in *Bairstow*. **Strength: Moderate**

### Supporting Legislation
- Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), s.66V(3), s.66W(2)(c)

## Argument 3: Pretextual Restructuring

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc.'s stated reason of "company restructuring" for terminating Robert Chen's employment was pretextual and designed to mask age discrimination in violation of s.66V and s.66W of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA).

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: While the EO Act does not explicitly address pretext, the Tribunal in *Bairstow* at [76] recognized that "a decision may be logical and understandable by reference to the assumptions upon which it is based. But those assumptions may overlook or discount the discriminatory impact of the decision." This principle allows the Tribunal to look beyond the stated reasons for a decision to determine whether discrimination occurred.

In *Al-Shabib v Curtin University of Technology* [2021] WASAT 20 at [9-22], the Tribunal emphasized that in direct discrimination cases, the complainant must establish that the protected attribute (in this case, age) was a causal factor in the less favorable treatment.

**Application**: The facts strongly suggest that TechFuture's "restructuring" explanation was pretextual:

1. Mr. Chen received "exceeds expectations" in his performance review just two months before termination, contradicting any performance-based justification

2. The company posted a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities just three weeks after termination, suggesting the position was not truly eliminated but rather the company sought to replace Mr. Chen with a younger employee

3. The statistical evidence shows that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite this age group representing only 31% of the workforce, indicating a pattern of targeting older employees

Unlike in *Al-Shabib*, where the applicant failed to establish any factual basis for his discrimination claim, Mr. Chen has concrete evidence suggesting the stated reason for termination was not genuine. The facts here are more compelling than in *Bairstow*, where the Tribunal found insufficient evidence that the selection panel's consideration of the applicant being "overqualified" was a proxy for age discrimination.

The timing of events—excellent performance review, followed by termination for "restructuring," followed quickly by posting a nearly identical "junior" position—creates a strong inference that the restructuring was pretextual and that age was a factor in the termination decision.

### Conclusion
There is strong evidence that TechFuture's stated reason of "company restructuring" for terminating Mr. Chen's employment was pretextual and designed to mask age discrimination. The timing of events, statistical evidence, and posting of a nearly identical "junior" position create a compelling case that age was a factor in the termination decision. **Strength: Strong**

### Supporting Legislation

## Argument 4: Vicarious Liability

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc. is vicariously liable for age discrimination carried out by its employees during the "restructuring" process under s.161 of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA).

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: Section 161 of the EO Act establishes that where an employee or agent does an act in connection with their employment that would be unlawful under the Act, the employer is taken to have also done the act unless they took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee from doing such acts.

In *Li v Edith Cowan University* [2012] WASAT 72, the Tribunal recognized that for discrimination to be unlawful, it must occur in one of the circumstances outlined in the relevant provisions of the EO Act, including dismissal under s.66W(2)(c).

**Application**: If the decision to terminate Mr. Chen was made by managers or HR personnel within TechFuture Inc., the company would be vicariously liable for their discriminatory actions unless it can demonstrate it took all reasonable steps to prevent age discrimination in the restructuring process. The facts suggest no such preventative measures were in place:

1. The statistical disparity (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of the workforce) suggests no oversight or monitoring to prevent age-based discrimination in the restructuring process

2. The rapid replacement with a "junior" position indicates no meaningful review of termination decisions to ensure they were not based on discriminatory factors

3. The excellent performance reviews contradict the termination decision, suggesting inadequate checks and balances in the termination process

Unlike in *Al-Shabib*, where the university had established moderation processes for assessment marking, there is no evidence that TechFuture had any processes in place to prevent age discrimination in its restructuring decisions. The statistical evidence of disproportionate impact on older workers strongly suggests that no such safeguards were in place.

### Conclusion
There is strong evidence that TechFuture Inc. is vicariously liable for age discrimination carried out by its employees during the "restructuring" process. The statistical evidence and circumstances of Mr. Chen's termination strongly suggest that TechFuture did not take reasonable steps to prevent age discrimination in its restructuring decisions. **Strength: Strong**

   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. **Background**
   The applicant, who had 16 years of professional experience, was not selected for the position, which was intended to cover maternity leave. Following the selection process, he lodged complaints with the Public Sector Commission (PSC) and the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), alleging breaches of public sector standards and age discrimination, respectively.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**
   The case referenced the **Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA)**, particularly sections concerning discrimination on the grounds of age, including:
   - **Section 66V**: Defines discrimination on the ground of age.
   - **Section 66W**: Prohibits discrimination in employment arrangements.

4. **Key Arguments**
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: The applicant claimed he was treated less favorably due to his age, arguing that the requirement of 5-10 years of experience disproportionately affected older candidates. He contended that the selection panel's consideration of his extensive experience indicated bias against his age.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: The respondent argued that the reference to 5-10 years of experience was not a strict requirement but a guideline. They maintained that the applicant was not discriminated against based on age, as his qualifications were deemed overqualified for the role.

5. **Key Insights**
   The tribunal found that:
   - The selection panel did not consider the applicant's age during the selection process.
   - The requirement of 5-10 years of experience was not a condition for selection but a guideline to manage applications.
   - The applicant failed to prove that he was treated less favorably than younger candidates or that the experience requirement was unreasonable.

6. **Outcome**
   The tribunal dismissed the applicant's complaint, concluding that:
   - The applicant did not establish that he was discriminated against on the basis of age.
   - The selection process was conducted fairly, and the reasons for the applicant's non-selection were based on his perceived overqualification and fit for the role, rather than age discrimination. 

In summary, the tribunal ruled in favor of the respondent, affirming that the selection process adhered to the relevant standards and did not constitute age discrimination.
2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.
3. AL-SHABIB and CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (2021 WASAT 20) - Similarity: 0.4331
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination. The complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, leading Mr. Al-Shabib to seek a review by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT).

2. **Background**  
   Mr. Al-Shabib, an Iraqi-born Australian citizen, enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Education at Curtin University in February 2019. He claims that he received failing grades in his assessments for the unit EDS107 due to discriminatory practices by the university staff, specifically alleging that his age, race, and religion influenced the grading of his assignments. Curtin University denies these allegations.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   The case references several provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), including:
   - Sections 36, 53, and 66V concerning discrimination on the grounds of race, religious conviction, and age.
   - Section 67 regarding victimization.

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: Mr. Al-Shabib argues that his assignments were graded unfairly due to discrimination based on his age, race, and religion. He contends that the university's actions led to his failure in the unit and subsequent victimization after he raised complaints.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: Curtin University, through its staff, argues that the grading was conducted fairly and in accordance with established rubrics. They deny any discriminatory intent and assert that Mr. Al-Shabib's grades were reflective of his performance.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The tribunal found no evidence to support Mr. Al-Shabib's claims of discrimination or victimization. It concluded that:
   - The grading of Mr. Al-Shabib's assessments was consistent with the assessment criteria and was moderated by other staff members who were unaware of his identity and allegations.
   - There was no indication that the university staff acted with discriminatory intent, as they did not have access to information regarding Mr. Al-Shabib's race or religion at the time of marking.

6. **Outcome**  
   The tribunal dismissed Mr. Al-Shabib's complaints of discrimination and victimization. The decision was based on the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the finding that the university's actions were in line with standard academic practices. Consequently, Mr. Al-Shabib lost the case, while Curtin University was found not liable for any discriminatory actions.

# Legal Analysis: Age Discrimination in Tech Layoffs Case

## Key Insights

1. **Statistical Evidence of Disproportionate Impact**: The statistical disparity (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) provides compelling evidence of disproportionate impact on older workers, supporting both direct and indirect discrimination claims.

2. **Pretextual Restructuring**: The hiring of a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination strongly suggests the "restructuring" rationale was pretextual, similar to how the Tribunal in *Bairstow* examined whether stated requirements were genuine.

3. **Excellent Performance Record**: The client's consistent "exceeds expectations" performance reviews, including one just two months before termination, contradicts any performance-based justification for termination.

4. **Prima Facie Case**: The combination of statistical evidence, excellent performance reviews, and suspicious timing creates a strong prima facie case that shifts the practical burden to the employer to provide a convincing non-discriminatory explanation.

## Argument 1: Indirect Age Discrimination Under s.66V(3)

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process constituted indirect discrimination against the client on the ground of age under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA).

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: Section 66V(3) of the EO Act establishes that indirect discrimination occurs when an employer requires an employee to comply with a requirement or condition: (a) with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age comply or are able to comply; (b) which is not reasonable having regard to the circumstances; and (c) with which the aggrieved person does not or is not able to comply.

In *Bairstow* [2024] WASAT 103 at [138-139], the Tribunal acknowledged that while precise statistical evidence is ideal, "the Tribunal can take a commonsense approach to the issue and draw inferences based on the information provided, even if the precise statistical evidence is missing." The Tribunal further noted at [173] that "policy objectives may be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of a requirement or condition."

**Application**: The client's case presents compelling statistical evidence that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce. This statistical disparity is significantly stronger than in *Bairstow*, where the Tribunal had limited data about engineering graduates' ages.

The "restructuring" requirement appears to have disproportionately affected older workers, satisfying s.66V(3)(a). Unlike in *Dewan* (referenced in *Bairstow* at [138]), where the Tribunal had to rely on limited sample data from two universities, here we have comprehensive data covering the entire workforce and all terminated employees.

The requirement cannot be considered reasonable under s.66V(3)(b) given:
1. The client's excellent performance reviews, including one just two months before termination
2. The posting of a nearly identical "Junior Software Engineer" position shortly after termination
3. The absence of any legitimate business necessity that would justify disproportionately terminating older workers

Unlike in *Bairstow* where the panel had some legitimate concerns about "fit," here there is no evidence of performance issues that would make the termination reasonable.

### Conclusion
The statistical evidence strongly supports a finding of indirect discrimination under s.66V(3). The disproportionate impact on older workers, combined with the client's excellent performance record and the suspicious timing of hiring a junior replacement, creates a compelling case that would be difficult for the employer to rebut. **Strength: Strong**

### Supporting Cases

### Supporting Legislation

- Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), s.66W(1)(c)

## Argument 2: Direct Age Discrimination Under s.66V(1)

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against the client on the ground of age by terminating his employment while retaining younger employees and subsequently hiring a younger replacement.

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: Section 66V(1) of the EO Act defines direct discrimination as treating an aggrieved person less favorably than, in the same circumstances or circumstances that are not materially different, the discriminator treats or would treat a person who is not of that age.

In *Bairstow* [2024] WASAT 103 at [101], the Tribunal noted that "a reference in Part IVB of the EO Act, which includes s.66V(1)... to the doing of an act on the ground of age includes a reference to the doing of an act on the ground of two or more matters that include age, whether or not age is the dominant or substantial reason for the doing of the act."

In *Sanzana* [2011] WASAT 208 at [30], the Tribunal emphasized that to establish direct discrimination, "the applicant must demonstrate that he has, on the ground of [the protected attribute], been treated less favourably in the same circumstances than a person of a different [attribute]."

**Application**: The client can establish less favorable treatment by comparing his situation to:

1. **Younger employees retained during restructuring**: The statistical evidence (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) demonstrates that younger employees were significantly more likely to be retained during the restructuring.

2. **Junior Software Engineer hired after termination**: The company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities just three weeks after the client's termination, indicating a preference for a younger employee in essentially the same role.

Unlike in *Al-Shabib* [2021] WASAT 20, where the applicant failed to establish that he was treated differently from comparable students of different ages, here the statistical disparity clearly shows that older employees were treated less favorably in the restructuring process.

The client's excellent performance reviews, including one just two months before termination, establish that circumstances were not materially different between him and younger employees who were retained or subsequently hired. This distinguishes the case from situations where poor performance provided a non-discriminatory basis for termination.

### Conclusion
The statistical evidence of disproportionate impact on older workers, combined with the hiring of a junior replacement with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination, strongly supports a finding of direct discrimination under s.66V(1). **Strength: Moderate to Strong**

## Argument 3: Pretextual Restructuring as Evidence of Discrimination

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc.'s stated reason for termination ("company restructuring") was pretextual and concealed age discrimination.

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: While the EO Act does not explicitly address pretext, the Tribunal in *Bairstow* [2024] WASAT 103 at [51-54] examined whether stated requirements were genuine selection criteria or merely factors used to exclude certain candidates. The Tribunal noted at [20] that the applicant bears the burden of proving discrimination on the balance of probabilities, but as established in *Briginshaw v Briginshaw* (referenced in *Bairstow* at [20]), the Tribunal "must feel an actual persuasion that the discrimination alleged in fact occurred."

**Application**: Several factors strongly suggest that the "company restructuring" rationale was pretextual:

1. **Timing of replacement hiring**: The company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities just three weeks after the client's termination. This timing is significantly more suspicious than in *Bairstow*, where the panel at least had some legitimate concerns about the applicant's fit for the role.

2. **Statistical evidence**: The disproportionate impact on older workers (78% of terminated employees being over 40 despite representing only 31% of workforce) suggests age was a factor in determining who would be affected by the restructuring.

3. **Excellent performance record**: The client received an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination, contradicting any suggestion that performance issues motivated the decision.

Unlike in *Al-Shabib* [2021] WASAT 20, where the applicant failed to establish any connection between his protected attributes and the marking of his assessments, here the statistical evidence and suspicious timing create a strong inference that age was a factor in the termination decision.

### Conclusion
The suspicious timing and circumstances surrounding the termination and subsequent hiring, combined with the statistical evidence of disproportionate impact on older workers and the client's excellent performance record, strongly suggest that the "restructuring" rationale was pretextual and concealed age discrimination. **Strength: Strong**

## Argument 4: Burden of Proof and Prima Facie Case

### Issue
Whether the client has established a prima facie case of age discrimination that shifts the practical burden to TechFuture Inc. to provide a convincing non-discriminatory explanation.

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: As established in *Bairstow* [2024] WASAT 103 at [20], the applicant bears the burden of proving all matters necessary to establish discrimination on the balance of probabilities. However, in *Dewan* (referenced in *Bairstow* at [138-139]), the Tribunal acknowledged that precise statistical evidence is not always required, and inferences can be drawn from available information.

In *Hordyk and Wanslea Family Services Inc* [2022] WASAT 117 (referenced in *Bairstow* at [20]), the Tribunal confirmed that "the applicant has the burden of proving all matters necessary to establish his complaint."

**Application**: The client has established a strong prima facie case through:

1. **Statistical evidence**: 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce. This statistical disparity is significantly stronger than in *Bairstow*, where the Tribunal had limited data about engineering graduates' ages.

2. **Excellent performance reviews**: The client received an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination, contradicting any performance-based justification. This distinguishes the case from situations where poor performance provided a non-discriminatory basis for termination.

3. **Suspicious timing of replacement hiring**: The company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities just three weeks after the client's termination.

Unlike in *Sanzana* [2011] WASAT 208, where the applicant failed to identify a comparator who was treated more favorably, here the statistical evidence provides a clear basis for comparison between older and younger employees.

This evidence collectively creates a compelling inference of age discrimination that would be difficult for the employer to rebut without a convincing non-discriminatory explanation.

### Conclusion
The combination of statistical evidence, excellent performance reviews, and suspicious timing of the replacement hiring creates a compelling prima facie case that shifts the practical (though not legal) burden to the employer to provide a convincing non-discriminatory explanation. **Strength: Strong**

## Argument 5: Remedies Available Under the EO Act

### Issue
What remedies are available to the client if age discrimination is established?

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: Section 127(b)(i) of the EO Act permits the Tribunal to award damages up to $40,000 by way of compensation for loss and damage suffered by a complainant. As noted in *Bairstow* [2024] WASAT 103 at [193], "The $40,000 is a cap on damages, notwithstanding that in some cases they may be assessed as exceeding $40,000."

In *Hordyk* (referenced in *Bairstow* at [194-195]), the Tribunal observed that "Damages for non-economic loss are awarded to compensate for injury (including hurt, humiliation and other injury to feelings) suffered as a result of the contravening conduct" and "they are by their nature incapable of mathematical calculation."

In *Airflite Pty Ltd v Goyal* (referenced in *Bairstow* at [196]), Pullin J stated that "In awarding damages, the character and conduct of the respondent as well as the appellant should be taken into account in determining the quantum of damages. Awards should not be minimal, because this would tend to trivialise or diminish respect for the public policy to which the anti-discrimination legislation gave effect."

**Application**: If discrimination is established, the client would be entitled to damages for:

1. **Economic loss**: Lost salary and benefits resulting from the termination, potentially offset by any severance payment received and mitigated by subsequent employment.

2. **Non-economic loss**: Compensation for hurt, humiliation, and injury to feelings resulting from the discriminatory termination.

The client's case involves particularly egregious circumstances that would support a substantial damages award:

1. The client had 7 years of service with consistently excellent performance reviews
2. The statistical evidence suggests a systematic pattern of age discrimination
3. The pretextual nature of the "restructuring" rationale, as evidenced by the hiring of a junior replacement shortly after termination

Unlike in *Dewan* (referenced in *Bairstow* at [187-192]), where various factors reduced the complainant's chances of success in obtaining a position, here the client was already successfully employed with excellent performance reviews, strengthening the claim for damages.

### Conclusion
If discrimination is established, the client has a strong claim for substantial damages up to the statutory maximum of $40,000, encompassing both economic and non-economic loss. **Strength: Strong**

   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. **Background**
   The applicant, who had 16 years of professional experience, was not selected for the position, which was intended to cover maternity leave. Following the selection process, he lodged complaints with the Public Sector Commission (PSC) and the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), alleging breaches of public sector standards and age discrimination, respectively.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**
   The case referenced the **Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA)**, particularly sections concerning discrimination on the grounds of age, including:
   - **Section 66V**: Defines discrimination on the ground of age.
   - **Section 66W**: Prohibits discrimination in employment arrangements.

4. **Key Arguments**
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: The applicant claimed he was treated less favorably due to his age, arguing that the requirement of 5-10 years of experience disproportionately affected older candidates. He contended that the selection panel's consideration of his extensive experience indicated bias against his age.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: The respondent argued that the reference to 5-10 years of experience was not a strict requirement but a guideline. They maintained that the applicant was not discriminated against based on age, as his qualifications were deemed overqualified for the role.

5. **Key Insights**
   The tribunal found that:
   - The selection panel did not consider the applicant's age during the selection process.
   - The requirement of 5-10 years of experience was not a condition for selection but a guideline to manage applications.
   - The applicant failed to prove that he was treated less favorably than younger candidates or that the experience requirement was unreasonable.

6. **Outcome**
   The tribunal dismissed the applicant's complaint, concluding that:
   - The applicant did not establish that he was discriminated against on the basis of age.
   - The selection process was conducted fairly, and the reasons for the applicant's non-selection were based on his perceived overqualification and fit for the role, rather than age discrimination. 

In summary, the tribunal ruled in favor of the respondent, affirming that the selection process adhered to the relevant standards and did not constitute age discrimination.
2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.
3. AL-SHABIB and CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (2021 WASAT 20) - Similarity: 0.4331
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination. The complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, leading Mr. Al-Shabib to seek a review by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT).

2. **Background**  
   Mr. Al-Shabib, an Iraqi-born Australian citizen, enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Education at Curtin University in February 2019. He claims that he received failing grades in his assessments for the unit EDS107 due to discriminatory practices by the university staff, specifically alleging that his age, race, and religion influenced the grading of his assignments. Curtin University denies these allegations.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   The case references several provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), including:
   - Sections 36, 53, and 66V concerning discrimination on the grounds of race, religious conviction, and age.
   - Section 67 regarding victimization.

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: Mr. Al-Shabib argues that his assignments were graded unfairly due to discrimination based on his age, race, and religion. He contends that the university's actions led to his failure in the unit and subsequent victimization after he raised complaints.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: Curtin University, through its staff, argues that the grading was conducted fairly and in accordance with established rubrics. They deny any discriminatory intent and assert that Mr. Al-Shabib's grades were reflective of his performance.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The tribunal found no evidence to support Mr. Al-Shabib's claims of discrimination or victimization. It concluded that:
   - The grading of Mr. Al-Shabib's assessments was consistent with the assessment criteria and was moderated by other staff members who were unaware of his identity and allegations.
   - There was no indication that the university staff acted with discriminatory intent, as they did not have access to information regarding Mr. Al-Shabib's race or religion at the time of marking.

6. **Outcome**  
   The tribunal dismissed Mr. Al-Shabib's complaints of discrimination and victimization. The decision was based on the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the finding that the university's actions were in line with standard academic practices. Consequently, Mr. Al-Shabib lost the case, while Curtin University was found not liable for any discriminatory actions.

# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Statistical Evidence**: The statistical disparity in terminations (78% over 40 vs. 31% workforce representation) provides stronger prima facie evidence of age discrimination than was available in comparable cases like *Bairstow*.

2. **Pretext for Discrimination**: The employer's actions in terminating a high-performing employee and then hiring for a junior position with nearly identical responsibilities creates a stronger inference of pretext than in *Bairstow*, where legitimate performance concerns existed.

3. **Causation Evidence**: The combination of statistical evidence, excellent performance reviews, and replacement with a junior employee provides stronger circumstantial evidence of causation than was present in comparable cases like *Al-Shabib*, where causation could not be established.

4. **Indirect Discrimination**: If the "restructuring" involved selection criteria that disproportionately affected older workers, this could constitute indirect discrimination under s.66V(3), particularly given the statistical evidence of disparate impact.

## Argument 1: Direct Age Discrimination in Employment Termination

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the ground of age by terminating his employment as part of a company "restructuring."

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: Section 66V(1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) provides that a person discriminates against another on the ground of age if, on the ground of the aggrieved person's age or a characteristic that appertains generally to persons of that age, the discriminator treats the aggrieved person less favorably than they would treat a person of a different age in the same circumstances. Section 66W(1)(c) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing the employee.

As established in *Bairstow v Director General of DJTSI* [2024] WASAT 103 at [51], direct discrimination "occurs where one person is treated in a different manner (less favourably) from the manner in which another is or would be treated in comparable circumstances on the ground of some unacceptable consideration" such as age. Importantly, per s.5 of the EO Act, age need not be the dominant or substantial reason for the termination, merely a contributing factor.

**Application**: Mr. Chen's case presents significantly stronger evidence of direct age discrimination than was available in *Bairstow*. The statistical analysis showing that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce, creates a compelling prima facie case of age discrimination. This statistical disparity is far more pronounced than in *Bairstow*, where the Tribunal found insufficient statistical evidence to support the applicant's claim.

Unlike in *Al-Shabib v Curtin University* [2021] WASAT 20, where the Tribunal found no evidence that the complainant's protected attribute influenced the decision-makers, here there is substantial circumstantial evidence that age was a factor in the termination decision. Mr. Chen had "consistently received excellent performance reviews" including an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination, eliminating performance as a legitimate reason for his inclusion in the restructuring.

The posting of a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with responsibilities nearly identical to Mr. Chen's former position just three weeks after his termination further strengthens the inference that the "restructuring" was pretextual and that age was a factor in the termination decision.

### Conclusion
The evidence strongly suggests that Mr. Chen was directly discriminated against on the ground of age in violation of s.66V(1) and s.66W(1)(c) of the EO Act. The statistical evidence, excellent performance record, and hiring of a junior replacement collectively create a compelling prima facie case that would likely shift the evidentiary burden to the employer to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination. **Strength: Strong**

## Argument 2: "Restructuring" as Pretext for Age Discrimination

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc.'s claim of "company restructuring" was a pretext for age discrimination against Mr. Chen.

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: As established in *Bairstow* at [101], the Tribunal will examine whether purported non-discriminatory reasons are genuine or merely pretextual. Section 66V(1) of the EO Act prohibits less favorable treatment on the ground of age, even if age is not the dominant or substantial reason for the treatment (per s.5 of the EO Act).

In *Sanzana v Director General, Disability Services Commission* [2011] WASAT 208 at [30-31], the Tribunal emphasized that to establish a claim of discrimination, the applicant must demonstrate that they have been treated less favorably in the same circumstances than a person of a different protected attribute, and that the less favorable treatment is due to that protected attribute.

**Application**: The facts of Mr. Chen's case strongly suggest that the "restructuring" was a pretext for age discrimination. In *Bairstow*, the Tribunal accepted that concerns about the applicant being "overqualified" were legitimate in the context of that case, where there were documented performance concerns. However, Mr. Chen's case is clearly distinguishable because:

1. He had "consistently received excellent performance reviews" including an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination, eliminating performance as a legitimate reason for his inclusion in the restructuring.

2. The company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with responsibilities nearly identical to Mr. Chen's former position just three weeks after his termination, suggesting the position was not truly eliminated as part of a legitimate restructuring.

3. The statistical evidence shows that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce, suggesting the "restructuring" disproportionately targeted older workers.

Unlike in *Li v Edith Cowan University* [2012] WASAT 72, where the Tribunal found no cogent evidence that the complainant was dismissed by reason of his protected attribute, here there is substantial evidence suggesting age was a factor in the termination decision disguised as "restructuring."

### Conclusion
The evidence strongly suggests that TechFuture Inc.'s claim of "company restructuring" was a pretext for age discrimination against Mr. Chen. The combination of excellent performance reviews, the hiring of a junior replacement with nearly identical responsibilities, and the statistical disparity in terminations creates a compelling inference that the "restructuring" was not genuine but rather a mechanism to terminate older employees. **Strength: Strong**

- *Sanzana v Director General, Disability Services Commission* [2011] WASAT 208

### Supporting Legislation
- Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), s.66V(1), s.5

## Argument 3: Indirect Age Discrimination in Restructuring Criteria

### Issue
Whether TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process involved criteria that constituted indirect discrimination against Mr. Chen on the ground of age.

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: Section 66V(3) of the EO Act provides that a person discriminates against another on the ground of age if they require the aggrieved person to comply with a requirement or condition: (a) with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age comply or are able to comply; (b) which is not reasonable having regard to the circumstances; and (c) with which the aggrieved person does not or is not able to comply.

In *Bairstow* at [169], the Tribunal noted that "indirect discrimination occurs where one person appears to be treated just as another is or would be treated but the impact of such equal treatment is that the former is treated less favourably than the latter." The Tribunal in *Dewan* (referenced in *Bairstow* at [176-192]) accepted that statistical evidence could establish that a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age could comply with a requirement.

**Application**: While the specific criteria used in TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" are not explicitly stated in the case facts, the statistical evidence strongly suggests that whatever criteria were used had a disparate impact on older workers. The fact that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the company's workforce, creates a strong inference that the restructuring criteria disproportionately affected older workers.

In *Dewan* (as discussed in *Bairstow*), the Tribunal noted that precise statistical data is not required to draw appropriate inferences about disparate impact. The statistical disparity in Mr. Chen's case is more pronounced than what was presented in *Dewan*, where the Tribunal found indirect discrimination despite acknowledging limitations in the statistical evidence.

If the restructuring criteria included factors that correlate with age (such as salary level, years of experience, or specific technical skills that might favor younger workers), these could constitute requirements or conditions with which a substantially higher proportion of younger workers could comply, and which were not reasonable having regard to the circumstances.

### Conclusion
The statistical evidence strongly suggests that TechFuture Inc.'s restructuring criteria had a disparate impact on older workers, potentially constituting indirect discrimination under s.66V(3) of the EO Act. While the specific criteria used in the restructuring are not explicitly stated, the statistical disparity creates a strong inference that would likely shift the burden to the employer to demonstrate the reasonableness of whatever criteria were used. **Strength: Moderate**

- *Dewan* (as referenced in *Bairstow*)

### Supporting Legislation

## Argument 4: Burden of Proof and Causation

### Issue
Whether the evidence is sufficient to establish that Mr. Chen's age was a factor in TechFuture Inc.'s decision to terminate his employment.

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: As established in *Bairstow* at [22-23], the applicant has the burden of proving all matters necessary to establish their complaint on the balance of probabilities. However, per s.5 of the EO Act, a reference to the doing of an act on the ground of age includes a reference to the doing of an act on the ground of two or more matters that include age, whether or not age is the dominant or substantial reason for the doing of the act.

In *Bairstow* at [63-64], the Tribunal noted that direct evidence of discriminatory intent is rarely available, and discrimination cases often rely on circumstantial evidence and inferences. The Tribunal must feel an actual persuasion that the discrimination alleged in fact occurred, applying the standard articulated in *Briginshaw v Briginshaw* (as referenced in *Bairstow* at [24-25]).

**Application**: The evidence in Mr. Chen's case creates a compelling prima facie case that age was at least one factor in the termination decision. The statistical evidence showing that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite representing only 31% of the workforce creates a strong inference that age was a factor in the restructuring decisions.

Unlike in *Al-Shabib* [2021] WASAT 20, where the Tribunal found no evidence that the complainant's protected attribute influenced the decision-makers, here there is substantial circumstantial evidence that age was a factor in the termination decision:

1. Mr. Chen had "consistently received excellent performance reviews" including an "exceeds expectations" rating just two months before termination, eliminating performance as a legitimate reason for his inclusion in the restructuring.

2. The company posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with responsibilities nearly identical to Mr. Chen's former position just three weeks after his termination, suggesting the position was not truly eliminated.

3. The statistical disparity in terminations (78% over 40 vs. 31% workforce representation) is significant enough to create an inference of discriminatory intent.

This evidence is significantly stronger than what was presented in comparable cases like *Al-Shabib* and *Li*, where causation could not be established.

### Conclusion
The combination of statistical evidence, excellent performance reviews, and replacement with a junior employee provides compelling circumstantial evidence that age was a factor in the termination decision. This evidence is sufficient to establish a prima facie case that would likely shift the evidentiary burden to the employer to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination. **Strength: Strong**

### Supporting Legislation
- Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), s.5, s.66V, s.66W

## Argument 5: Remedies Available Under the Equal Opportunity Act

### Issue
What remedies are available to Mr. Chen if his complaint of age discrimination is substantiated?

### Legal Reasoning
**Rule**: Section 127 of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) provides that after holding an inquiry, the Tribunal may dismiss the complaint or find it substantiated and make orders including: (a) an order requiring the respondent to pay compensation to the complainant for loss or damage suffered; (b) an order requiring the respondent to cease or not repeat any discriminatory conduct; (c) an order requiring the respondent to perform any reasonable act to redress any loss or damage suffered by the complainant.

In *Bairstow* at [493-498], the Tribunal discussed the principles for awarding damages, noting that damages for non-economic loss are awarded to compensate for injury (including hurt, humiliation and other injury to feelings) suffered as a result of the contravening conduct. The Tribunal referenced *Airflite Pty Ltd v Goyal* [2003] WASCA 45, which established that awards should not be minimal, as this would tend to trivialize or diminish respect for the public policy to which the anti-discrimination legislation gave effect.

**Application**: If Mr. Chen's complaint is substantiated, he would be entitled to seek compensation for both economic and non-economic loss. The economic loss would include lost wages and benefits from the date of termination, potentially reduced by any mitigation through subsequent employment. Given Mr. Chen's senior position and excellent performance record, these damages could be substantial.

In *Bairstow* at [494], the Tribunal noted that s.127(b)(i) of the EO Act permits the Tribunal to award damages up to $40,000 by way of compensation for loss and damage suffered by a complainant. This cap applies even if the actual damages exceed that amount.

In *Dewan* (as discussed in *Bairstow* at [66-71]), the Tribunal considered damages for lost opportunity in a discrimination case. Given the strong evidence in Mr. Chen's case, particularly the excellent performance reviews and the hiring of a junior replacement, there would be a strong basis for arguing that Mr. Chen had a high probability of continued employment absent the discriminatory termination.

### Conclusion
If Mr. Chen's complaint is substantiated, he would be entitled to seek compensation for both economic and non-economic loss under s.127 of the EO Act. Given the strength of the evidence and the senior nature of his position, there would be a strong basis for seeking substantial damages, potentially up to the statutory cap of $40,000. **Strength: Strong**

   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. **Background**
   The applicant, who had 16 years of professional experience, was not selected for the position, which was intended to cover maternity leave. Following the selection process, he lodged complaints with the Public Sector Commission (PSC) and the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), alleging breaches of public sector standards and age discrimination, respectively.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**
   The case referenced the **Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA)**, particularly sections concerning discrimination on the grounds of age, including:
   - **Section 66V**: Defines discrimination on the ground of age.
   - **Section 66W**: Prohibits discrimination in employment arrangements.

4. **Key Arguments**
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: The applicant claimed he was treated less favorably due to his age, arguing that the requirement of 5-10 years of experience disproportionately affected older candidates. He contended that the selection panel's consideration of his extensive experience indicated bias against his age.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: The respondent argued that the reference to 5-10 years of experience was not a strict requirement but a guideline. They maintained that the applicant was not discriminated against based on age, as his qualifications were deemed overqualified for the role.

5. **Key Insights**
   The tribunal found that:
   - The selection panel did not consider the applicant's age during the selection process.
   - The requirement of 5-10 years of experience was not a condition for selection but a guideline to manage applications.
   - The applicant failed to prove that he was treated less favorably than younger candidates or that the experience requirement was unreasonable.

6. **Outcome**
   The tribunal dismissed the applicant's complaint, concluding that:
   - The applicant did not establish that he was discriminated against on the basis of age.
   - The selection process was conducted fairly, and the reasons for the applicant's non-selection were based on his perceived overqualification and fit for the role, rather than age discrimination. 

In summary, the tribunal ruled in favor of the respondent, affirming that the selection process adhered to the relevant standards and did not constitute age discrimination.
2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.
3. AL-SHABIB and CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (2021 WASAT 20) - Similarity: 0.4331
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination. The complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, leading Mr. Al-Shabib to seek a review by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT).

2. **Background**  
   Mr. Al-Shabib, an Iraqi-born Australian citizen, enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Education at Curtin University in February 2019. He claims that he received failing grades in his assessments for the unit EDS107 due to discriminatory practices by the university staff, specifically alleging that his age, race, and religion influenced the grading of his assignments. Curtin University denies these allegations.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   The case references several provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), including:
   - Sections 36, 53, and 66V concerning discrimination on the grounds of race, religious conviction, and age.
   - Section 67 regarding victimization.

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: Mr. Al-Shabib argues that his assignments were graded unfairly due to discrimination based on his age, race, and religion. He contends that the university's actions led to his failure in the unit and subsequent victimization after he raised complaints.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: Curtin University, through its staff, argues that the grading was conducted fairly and in accordance with established rubrics. They deny any discriminatory intent and assert that Mr. Al-Shabib's grades were reflective of his performance.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The tribunal found no evidence to support Mr. Al-Shabib's claims of discrimination or victimization. It concluded that:
   - The grading of Mr. Al-Shabib's assessments was consistent with the assessment criteria and was moderated by other staff members who were unaware of his identity and allegations.
   - There was no indication that the university staff acted with discriminatory intent, as they did not have access to information regarding Mr. Al-Shabib's race or religion at the time of marking.

6. **Outcome**  
   The tribunal dismissed Mr. Al-Shabib's complaints of discrimination and victimization. The decision was based on the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the finding that the university's actions were in line with standard academic practices. Consequently, Mr. Al-Shabib lost the case, while Curtin University was found not liable for any discriminatory actions.

# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Age as Protected Attribute in Employment Termination**: The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) explicitly prohibits discrimination on the ground of age in employment termination. In the client's case, statistical evidence showing 78% of terminated employees were over 40 (despite representing only 31% of the workforce) creates a prima facie case of age discrimination. Strength: Strong

2. **Direct vs. Indirect Discrimination Framework**: The client's case presents elements of both direct discrimination (being treated less favorably due to age) and indirect discrimination (the "restructuring" having a disproportionate impact on older workers). The statistical disparity and subsequent hiring of a junior employee with similar responsibilities strongly suggests age was a factor in the termination decision. Strength: Strong

3. **Burden of Proof and Causation**: As established in Bairstow, the complainant must show that age was at least one of the grounds for the termination, though it need not be the dominant reason. The client's excellent performance reviews just prior to termination, combined with the statistical evidence and replacement hiring, creates a compelling causation argument. Strength: Moderate

4. **Comparator Analysis**: The appropriate comparator would be younger employees with similar performance records who were not terminated during the restructuring. The hiring of a junior employee with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination provides a strong basis for establishing less favorable treatment. Strength: Strong

## Key Arguments

### Title: Direct Age Discrimination in Employment Termination

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66V(1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), direct discrimination occurs when a person is treated less favorably on the ground of age than a person of a different age would be treated in the same or not materially different circumstances. Section 66W(1)(c) specifically prohibits employers from dismissing employees on the ground of age.

The client's termination as part of a "restructuring" that disproportionately affected older workers (78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite this group representing only 31% of the workforce), combined with his consistently excellent performance reviews (including "exceeds expectations" just two months prior), and the subsequent hiring of a junior employee with nearly identical responsibilities, establishes a strong prima facie case that age was at least one factor in the termination decision.

As established in Bairstow, age need not be the dominant reason for the termination; it is sufficient if it is one of multiple factors. The statistical evidence alone creates a compelling inference that age was a factor in the restructuring decisions.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Bairstow v Director General of the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation [2024] WASAT 103 - established that discrimination on the ground of age will be established even if age is only one of a number of reasons for the doing of the act.

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Indirect Age Discrimination Through "Restructuring" Process

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66V(3) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition with which a substantially higher proportion of persons not of the same age can comply, which is not reasonable in the circumstances, and with which the aggrieved person cannot comply.

The "restructuring" process appears to have operated as a de facto requirement or condition that disproportionately affected older workers. The statistical evidence (78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite representing only 31% of the workforce) demonstrates that a substantially higher proportion of younger employees were able to "comply" with the restructuring (i.e., retain their employment).

The reasonableness of the restructuring must be questioned given: (1) the client's excellent performance reviews, (2) the continued need for someone to perform the client's duties (as evidenced by the hiring of a junior replacement), and (3) the statistical disparity in terminations by age.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Dewan v Minister for Education [2007] WASCA 151 - established principles for determining indirect discrimination, including the selection of appropriate comparator groups and statistical evidence.
- Banovic v Australian Iron & Steel [1989] HCA 56 - established that selection of an appropriate sample is a statistically acceptable means of calculating proportions for indirect discrimination claims.

**Strength**: Moderate

### Title: Pretextual Termination Disguised as Restructuring

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under s.66W of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of age by dismissing the employee. Where a purported business reason is given for termination, courts will examine whether this reason is genuine or pretextual.

The evidence strongly suggests the "restructuring" was pretextual with respect to the client: (1) excellent performance reviews including "exceeds expectations" just two months before termination, (2) the hiring of a junior employee with nearly identical responsibilities just three weeks after termination, and (3) the statistical evidence showing disproportionate impact on older workers.

The timing and circumstances of the junior replacement hire are particularly compelling evidence that the client's position was not truly eliminated through restructuring, but rather that the employer sought to replace an older worker with a younger one.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Sanzana v Director General, Disability Services Commission [2011] WASAT 208 - demonstrates the Tribunal's approach to examining whether stated reasons for termination are genuine.
- Thompson v Big Bert Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1978 - while the discrimination claim was unsuccessful, the case illustrates how courts analyze whether stated reasons for adverse employment actions are pretextual.

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Statistical Evidence of Systemic Age Discrimination

**Legal Reasoning**: 
While not explicitly addressed in the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), statistical evidence of disparate impact is recognized as a valid method of establishing discrimination. The statistical disparity in this case (78% of terminated employees were over 40 despite representing only 31% of the workforce) creates a strong inference of systemic age discrimination.

As established in Bairstow, the Tribunal can take a commonsense approach to statistical evidence and draw inferences based on the information provided. The statistical disparity in this case is so significant that it would be difficult to attribute to chance or non-discriminatory factors, particularly given the client's strong performance record and the subsequent hiring of a junior replacement.

The employer would bear the burden of explaining this statistical disparity with legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. Given the client's excellent performance and the continued need for someone to perform his duties, the employer would likely struggle to provide a convincing non-discriminatory explanation.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Dewan v Minister for Education [2007] WASCA 151 - recognized the validity of statistical evidence in establishing discrimination.
- Bairstow v Director General of the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation [2024] WASAT 103 - established that precise statistical data is not required if reasonable inferences can be drawn.

**Strength**: Strong

## Conclusion and Recommended Approach

Based on the analysis above, the client has a strong case for age discrimination under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). The most compelling arguments are:

1. The direct discrimination claim based on the statistical evidence, excellent performance reviews, and replacement with a junior employee.

2. The pretextual nature of the "restructuring" as evidenced by the hiring of a junior replacement with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination.

The client should pursue a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Commission of Western Australia, emphasizing these key arguments and the statistical evidence of disparate impact. If unsuccessful at the Commission level, the client should consider requesting referral to the State Administrative Tribunal, where the statistical evidence and individual circumstances can be more thoroughly examined.

The client should also gather any additional evidence of age-related comments or patterns in the workplace that might strengthen the causal connection between age and the termination decision.

   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**
   The case involves an applicant who applied for a position as a trade and investment manager with the Office of the Agent General in London. The applicant alleged discrimination based on age after being ranked fourth among candidates, despite being deemed suitable for the role.

2. **Background**
   The applicant, who had 16 years of professional experience, was not selected for the position, which was intended to cover maternity leave. Following the selection process, he lodged complaints with the Public Sector Commission (PSC) and the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), alleging breaches of public sector standards and age discrimination, respectively.

2. SANZANA and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DISABILITY SERVICES COMMISSION (2011 WASAT 208) - Similarity: 0.4469
   Summary: **1. Introduction**  
This case involves an applicant, Mr. Sanzana, who was employed as a social trainer by the respondent, the Disability Services Commission. He claimed discrimination on the grounds of race and victimization following his dismissal from employment. The Equal Opportunity Commissioner dismissed his complaints, leading to a referral to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

**2. Background**  
Mr. Sanzana, originally from Chile, worked for the Disability Services Commission for approximately seven years. His employment was terminated following allegations of substandard work performance and inappropriate behavior towards residents. He alleged that his dismissal was a result of discrimination based on his race and that he faced victimization for raising complaints against his supervisors.

**3. Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) concerning discrimination and victimization, as well as the State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004 (WA), particularly Section 47, which allows for the dismissal of proceedings deemed frivolous or lacking in substance.

**4. Key Arguments**  
- **Applicant's Argument:** Mr. Sanzana argued that he was discriminated against based on his race, particularly after he made complaints against his supervisors. He claimed that his work performance issues arose only after he lodged these complaints.
- **Respondent's Argument:** The Disability Services Commission contended that the applicant's claims were frivolous and lacked substance, asserting that his dismissal was based on substantiated performance issues and not on any discriminatory practices.

**5. Key Insights**  
The Tribunal found that Mr. Sanzana's complaint of discrimination was misconceived, as he failed to demonstrate that he was treated less favorably than a person of a different race in similar circumstances. Furthermore, the Tribunal concluded that his claim of victimization was lacking in substance, as he did not make any allegations of discrimination to his supervisors prior to his dismissal.

**6. Outcome**  
The Tribunal upheld the respondent's application to dismiss the proceedings under Section 47 of the SAT Act. Mr. Sanzana's application was dismissed in its entirety, as the Tribunal found no realistic prospect of success for his claims of discrimination and victimization. The respondent won the case, as the Tribunal determined that the applicant's complaints were unfounded and lacked sufficient evidence.
3. AL-SHABIB and CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (2021 WASAT 20) - Similarity: 0.4331
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision: Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib v. Curtin University of Technology

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves Mr. Whamid Al-Shabib, who alleges that Curtin University discriminated against him based on age, race, and religious conviction, and subsequently victimized him after he lodged a complaint regarding this discrimination. The complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, leading Mr. Al-Shabib to seek a review by the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT).

2. **Background**  
   Mr. Al-Shabib, an Iraqi-born Australian citizen, enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Education at Curtin University in February 2019. He claims that he received failing grades in his assessments for the unit EDS107 due to discriminatory practices by the university staff, specifically alleging that his age, race, and religion influenced the grading of his assignments. Curtin University denies these allegations.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   The case references several provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), including:
   - Sections 36, 53, and 66V concerning discrimination on the grounds of race, religious conviction, and age.
   - Section 67 regarding victimization.

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **Applicant's Arguments**: Mr. Al-Shabib argues that his assignments were graded unfairly due to discrimination based on his age, race, and religion. He contends that the university's actions led to his failure in the unit and subsequent victimization after he raised complaints.
   - **Respondent's Arguments**: Curtin University, through its staff, argues that the grading was conducted fairly and in accordance with established rubrics. They deny any discriminatory intent and assert that Mr. Al-Shabib's grades were reflective of his performance.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The tribunal found no evidence to support Mr. Al-Shabib's claims of discrimination or victimization. It concluded that:
   - The grading of Mr. Al-Shabib's assessments was consistent with the assessment criteria and was moderated by other staff members who were unaware of his identity and allegations.
   - There was no indication that the university staff acted with discriminatory intent, as they did not have access to information regarding Mr. Al-Shabib's race or religion at the time of marking.

6. **Outcome**  
   The tribunal dismissed Mr. Al-Shabib's complaints of discrimination and victimization. The decision was based on the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the finding that the university's actions were in line with standard academic practices. Consequently, Mr. Al-Shabib lost the case, while Curtin University was found not liable for any discriminatory actions.

# Legal Analysis: Tappers Ltd v. Bonizo Pty Ltd

## Key Insights

1. **Breach of Essential Term**: Bonizo's pattern of late deliveries and complete non-deliveries constitutes a serious breach of an essential term, given the time-sensitive nature of restaurant food supplies and the explicit contractual requirement for Wednesday deliveries.

2. **Repudiatory Conduct**: The three consecutive weeks of non-delivery, combined with the pattern of unreliable service, likely constitutes repudiatory conduct that would entitle Tappers to terminate the contract.

3. **Force Majeure Limitations**: The force majeure clause would only protect Bonizo if they can demonstrate the delays were caused by genuinely unforeseen circumstances beyond their control, not merely operational inefficiencies.

4. **Commercial Impact**: The significant operational and financial impact on Tappers' restaurant operations strengthens their position for both termination rights and damages claims.

## Final Arguments

### Argument 1: Serious Breach of Essential Term

**Issue**: Whether Bonizo's late deliveries and non-deliveries constitute a serious breach of an essential term sufficient to justify termination of the contract.

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under Australian contract law, a party may terminate a contract when there has been a serious breach of an essential term. Time is considered an essential term when the contract explicitly makes it so or when the nature of the business makes timely performance critical. The contract between Tappers and Bonizo explicitly requires deliveries "by Wednesday afternoon in time for the peak dinner nights from Thursday till Sunday," establishing time as an essential term given the perishable nature of restaurant supplies.

Bonizo has breached this essential term through: (1) late deliveries in June, and (2) complete non-delivery for three consecutive weeks in July. In *Andrews and Building and Maintenance Services (WA) Pty Ltd* [2012] WASAT 173, the Tribunal emphasized that when assessing contractual obligations, the Tribunal must consider whether the party has acted in accordance with what was reasonably expected under the contract. The repeated failure to deliver on time falls significantly below what would be reasonably expected in a food delivery contract for restaurants.

**Supporting Cases**:
- *Andrews and Building and Maintenance Services (WA) Pty Ltd* [2012] WASAT 173
- *Patronus Holdings Pty Ltd and Stamor Pty Ltd* [2019] WASAT 147

**Conclusion**: Bonizo's pattern of late deliveries and non-deliveries constitutes a serious breach of an essential term of the contract, entitling Tappers to terminate the contract. **Strength: Strong**

### Argument 2: Repudiatory Conduct

**Issue**: Whether Bonizo's pattern of late deliveries and non-deliveries demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to perform the contract according to its terms.

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under Australian contract law, a party may terminate a contract where the other party's conduct demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to perform the contract according to its terms. This principle was applied in *Patronus Holdings Pty Ltd and Stamor Pty Ltd* [2019] WASAT 147, where the Tribunal found that where a party demonstrates an inability to perform as required, the other party may be entitled to terminate.

Bonizo's pattern of late deliveries and complete non-delivery for three consecutive weeks in July demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to perform the contract according to its terms. The restaurant's statement that "it's unpredictable and is tough on us" indicates the unreliability has created significant operational challenges. The three-week complete non-delivery period is particularly significant as it forced Tappers to source food "on an urgent basis from local suppliers at a high cost," effectively requiring them to make alternative arrangements that the contract was designed to avoid.

**Supporting Cases**:
- *Patronus Holdings Pty Ltd and Stamor Pty Ltd* [2019] WASAT 147
- *Bonser and TGSBC PTY LTD* [2015] WASAT 110

**Conclusion**: Bonizo's conduct constitutes repudiation of the contract, entitling Tappers to terminate the contract despite the two-year term. **Strength: Strong**

### Argument 3: Ineffectiveness of Force Majeure Clause

**Issue**: Whether the force majeure clause in the contract protects Bonizo from liability for its late deliveries and non-performance.

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Force majeure clauses are interpreted narrowly by Australian courts and only excuse non-performance when the specific circumstances fall within the scope of the clause. The party seeking to rely on a force majeure clause bears the burden of proving that the circumstances preventing performance fall within the clause's scope.

The force majeure clause states: "the seller shall not be liable for delays in performance or non-performance due to unforeseen circumstances or reasons beyond the Seller's reasonable control, including any act of God." For this clause to protect Bonizo, they must demonstrate that the delays and non-deliveries were caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond their reasonable control. 

In *Building Services Board and Morton* [2021] WASAT 129, the Tribunal emphasized that parties seeking to rely on exclusionary clauses must demonstrate they took reasonable precautions and interventions as would be expected under the circumstances. There is no evidence that Bonizo has provided any explanation for the delays or non-deliveries that would qualify as "unforeseen circumstances" or "beyond reasonable control." The pattern of unreliability suggests systemic operational issues rather than isolated unforeseen events.

**Supporting Cases**:
- *Building Services Board and Morton* [2021] WASAT 129

**Conclusion**: Without evidence of specific qualifying events, the force majeure clause is unlikely to excuse Bonizo's non-performance. The burden is on Bonizo to prove these circumstances existed, and the pattern of breaches suggests systemic issues rather than isolated unforeseen events. **Strength: Moderate to Strong**

### Argument 4: Right to Damages for Breach

**Issue**: Whether Tappers is entitled to damages for the additional costs incurred as a result of Bonizo's breaches.

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under Australian contract law, the innocent party is entitled to damages that would put them in the position they would have been had the contract been performed properly. This includes direct losses and reasonably foreseeable consequential losses.

Tappers has suffered direct financial loss as a result of Bonizo's breaches, specifically having to "source food on an urgent basis from local suppliers at a high cost" during the three weeks of non-delivery. In *Patronus Holdings Pty Ltd and Stamor Pty Ltd* [2019] WASAT 147, the Tribunal held that "the amount of compensation to be paid is that amount which would put the owner in the position they would have been had the work been performed correctly or properly together with any loss consequential upon the faulty workmanship or breach of contract."

The significant operational and financial impact on Tappers' restaurant business strengthens their position for damages. Tappers would be entitled to recover the additional costs incurred for emergency food sourcing, as well as any other direct losses resulting from the breaches.

**Supporting Cases**:
- *Patronus Holdings Pty Ltd and Stamor Pty Ltd* [2019] WASAT 147
- *Bonser and TGSBC PTY LTD* [2015] WASAT 110

**Conclusion**: Tappers is entitled to damages for the additional costs incurred as a result of having to source food at higher costs from alternative suppliers, as there is a clear causal link between Bonizo's breaches and these losses. **Strength: Strong**

## Advice to Tappers Ltd

Based on the above analysis, I advise Tappers Ltd that:

1. They have strong grounds to terminate their contract with Bonizo Pty Ltd based on Bonizo's serious breaches of an essential term and repudiatory conduct.

2. The force majeure clause is unlikely to protect Bonizo without specific evidence of qualifying unforeseen circumstances beyond their control.

3. Tappers should document all instances of breach, the commercial impact, and any additional costs incurred before formally terminating the contract.

4. Tappers is entitled to claim damages for the additional costs incurred in sourcing food from alternative suppliers during the periods of non-delivery.

5. If the contract contains a force majeure clause as described, Tappers should request evidence from Bonizo that the delays and non-deliveries were caused by circumstances falling within the scope of the clause. Without such evidence, the clause will not protect Bonizo from liability.

1. BONSER and TGSBC PTY LTD (2015 WASAT 110) - Similarity: 0.3995
   Summary: ### 1. Introduction
This case involves a dispute between the applicants, Mr. and Mrs. Bonser, and the respondent, TGSBC Pty Ltd trading as Chessington Homes, regarding the completion status of a residential construction project. The applicants lodged a complaint concerning whether practical completion of their dwelling had been achieved and sought delay damages amounting to $29,668.50.

### 2. Background
The applicants entered into a contract with the respondent for the construction of a dwelling at 14 Brentwood Way, The Vines, Western Australia. Following a series of inspections and disputes over the completion status of the dwelling, the Building Commissioner determined that practical completion had not been achieved and issued a remedy order requiring the respondent to complete the necessary works. The applicants claimed that they were denied proper access to inspect the dwelling fully, which led to the current proceedings before the Tribunal.

### 3. Relevant Acts and Legislation
The primary legislation referenced in this case is the Building Services (Complaint Resolution and Administration) Act 2011 (WA) (BSCRA Act), under which the complaint was lodged and subsequently referred to the Tribunal.

### 4. Key Arguments
- **Applicants' Argument**: The applicants contended that practical completion had not been achieved and that they required further access to the dwelling to conduct a complete inspection, which they argued was necessary to substantiate their claims.
- **Respondent's Argument**: The respondent asserted that practical completion had been achieved as of April 10, 2014, and that the applicants had ample opportunity to inspect the dwelling. The respondent objected to any further inspection, claiming it was unnecessary and asserting compliance with the Building Commissioner's order.

### 5. Key Insights
The Tribunal found that the applicants had previously conducted inspections and had been provided access to the dwelling. The evidence indicated that the applicants had inspected the property multiple times and had raised issues that were subsequently addressed. The Tribunal concluded that the applicants did not require further inspection to present their case effectively, as they had sufficient information from prior inspections and reports to support their claims.

### 6. Outcome
The Tribunal ruled in favor of the respondent by refusing the applicants' request for orders compelling access to the dwelling for a further inspection. The Tribunal determined that the applicants had not demonstrated a need for additional inspection to advance their case, as they had already conducted inspections and received information regarding the completion status of the dwelling. The matter was scheduled for further directions, but the immediate request for inspection was denied.
2. ANDREWS and BUILDING AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES (WA) PTY LTD (2012 WASAT 173) - Similarity: 0.3994
   Summary: ### 1. Introduction
This case involves a complaint brought by Mr. and Mrs. Andrews against Building and Maintenance Services (WA) Pty Ltd (BMS) regarding alleged defects in the construction of a shed at their rural property in Kalgan, Western Australia. The primary issue was to determine who carried out the regulated building service concerning the shed's erection.

### 2. Background
The applicants, Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, entered into a contract with BMS for the supply of a kit shed. The dispute arose over whether BMS or the Andrews themselves, as approved owner-builders, were responsible for the construction of the shed. The parties presented conflicting accounts of their interactions and agreements regarding the construction work.

### 3. Relevant Acts and Legislation
The case references the following legislation:
- **Building Services (Complaint Resolution and Administration) Act 2011 (WA) (BS(CRA) Act)**, particularly section 5(1), which allows complaints about regulated building services not being carried out properly.
- **Building Services (Registration) Act 2011 (WA) (BS(R) Act)**, which defines terms such as "registered building service provider" and "approved owner-builder."

### 4. Key Arguments
- **Applicants' Argument**: The Andrews contended that BMS agreed to construct the shed, as evidenced by a handwritten note detailing payment for concrete and erection services. They argued that BMS, as a registered building service provider, was responsible for the quality of the work.
- **Respondent's Argument**: BMS claimed it only supplied the kit shed and that the Andrews engaged a subcontractor directly for the construction work. They argued that the Andrews, as owner-builders, were responsible for the erection of the shed.

### 5. Key Insights
The Tribunal found that:
- The evidence supported the Andrews' claim that BMS agreed to construct the shed, as they provided credible details and corroborating evidence.
- The handwritten note indicated a contractual agreement between the parties.
- The Tribunal rejected BMS's assertion that the Andrews directly engaged the subcontractor, concluding that BMS was responsible for the regulated building service.

### 6. Outcome
The Tribunal ruled in favor of the Andrews, determining that BMS carried out the building service in question. This conclusion was based on the evidence presented, including the handwritten note and the credibility of the Andrews' account compared to BMS's inconsistent statements. The matter was set for a directions hearing to determine the next steps in addressing the complaint regarding the quality of the construction.
3. BUILDING SERVICES BOARD and MORTON (2021 WASAT 129) - Similarity: 0.3956
   Summary: ### 1. Introduction
The State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) decision concerns disciplinary action against the respondent, a registered building service practitioner, for allegedly failing to properly discharge his duties as a nominated supervisor for M3 Building and Construction Pty Ltd (M3). The tribunal evaluated whether the respondent's actions warranted disciplinary measures under the Building Services (Registration) Act 2011 (WA).

### 2. Background
The respondent was employed by M3 as a nominated supervisor from June 23, 2014, to January 16, 2015. During this period, M3 was engaged in multiple residential building projects. The applicant alleged that the respondent did not adequately supervise these projects, leading to complaints from clients regarding workmanship issues. The respondent contended that he was not informed about all the projects and thus could not fulfill his supervisory responsibilities.

### 3. Relevant Acts and Legislation
The tribunal proceedings were initiated under sections 56(2)(c) and 56(2)(e) of the Building Services (Registration) Act 2011 (WA) (BSR Act). The tribunal's jurisdiction to impose disciplinary actions is outlined in section 58 of the BSR Act, which includes options such as reprimanding the provider, amending their registration, or imposing fines.

### 4. Key Arguments
- **Applicant's Argument**: The applicant argued that the respondent failed to perform his duties as a nominated supervisor, particularly in managing and supervising the ongoing projects. They claimed that he did not take necessary actions to ensure compliance with contractual and legislative requirements.
- **Respondent's Argument**: The respondent denied the allegations, asserting that he acted appropriately based on the limited information provided by M3. He claimed he was only aware of 10 to 12 projects and had made efforts to inquire about others.

### 5. Key Insights
The tribunal found that the respondent did not display the caution and diligence expected of a nominated supervisor. It concluded that he failed to ensure that he was fully informed about the projects he was responsible for and did not take adequate steps to supervise the work being done. The tribunal noted that the respondent's lack of insight and remorse during the proceedings further indicated a reckless disregard for his duties.

### 6. Outcome
The tribunal ruled in favor of the applicant, finding that there was sufficient cause for disciplinary action against the respondent. The respondent was reprimanded, his registration as a building service practitioner was cancelled, and he was fined $10,000. The tribunal determined that the respondent's actions constituted a serious failure to fulfill his responsibilities, putting public interests at risk.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at allenai/longformer-base-4096 were not used when initializing LongformerForSequenceClassification: ['lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.decoder.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing LongformerForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing LongformerForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of LongformerForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at allenai/longformer-base-4096 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.dense.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

# LEGAL ANALYSIS: AGE DISCRIMINATION IN TECH LAYOFFS

## Key Insights

1. **Disproportionate Impact on Older Workers**: The statistical evidence showing 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old (despite this age group representing only 31% of the workforce) creates a strong prima facie case of age discrimination. This pattern is similar to the indirect discrimination discussed in Johnston v Department of Communities (2019). Strength: **Strong**

2. **Replacement with Similar Position**: The company posting a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after termination strongly suggests pretext for age discrimination rather than genuine restructuring. This mirrors the reasoning in AA v RR (2019) where the timing and nature of replacement was considered significant. Strength: **Strong**

3. **Excellent Performance Record**: Mr. Chen's consistent "exceeds expectations" ratings, including one just two months before termination, contradicts the company's restructuring justification. This is comparable to Johnston's case where positive performance was inconsistent with the employer's actions. Strength: **Moderate**

4. **Burden of Proof in Discrimination Cases**: As established in Johnston and other cases, while the complainant bears the initial burden of establishing less favorable treatment, once a prima facie case is made, the respondent must provide a non-discriminatory explanation. The statistical evidence shifts this burden to the employer. Strength: **Strong**

## Key Arguments

### Title: Direct Age Discrimination in Employment Termination

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Under the Equal Opportunity Act, direct discrimination occurs when an employer treats an employee less favorably than they would treat a person of a different age in the same or not materially different circumstances. Mr. Chen was terminated despite excellent performance reviews, while younger employees with similar or lesser performance were retained. The company's actions in subsequently advertising for a nearly identical position with a "Junior" title demonstrates that the "restructuring" was merely pretext for removing older workers.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Johnston v Department of Communities (2019 WASAT 21): Established that discrimination can be found when an employee is treated less favorably than a comparator would be in similar circumstances.
- AA v RR (2019 WASAT 141): Demonstrated that the timing and nature of replacement can be evidence of discriminatory intent.

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Indirect Age Discrimination Through Restructuring Criteria

**Legal Reasoning**: 
Indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition that has a disproportionate impact on people of a particular age group and is not reasonable in the circumstances. The "restructuring" process appears to have had criteria that disproportionately impacted employees over 40 years old (78% of terminated employees versus 31% of workforce). The employer has not demonstrated that these criteria were reasonable or necessary for legitimate business purposes.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- Amazon v Department of Housing (2012 WASAT 11): Established that indirect discrimination requires showing that a condition disadvantages a protected group and is not reasonable in the circumstances.
- Carlisle v Commissioner of Police (2012 WASAT 90): Discussed how seemingly neutral policies can have discriminatory effects when they disproportionately impact protected groups.

**Strength**: Strong

### Title: Pretextual Termination Evidenced by Replacement Position

**Legal Reasoning**: 
The creation of a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities just three weeks after Mr. Chen's termination strongly suggests that the "restructuring" was pretextual. This indicates the company's true intention was to replace older, higher-paid employees with younger, presumably lower-paid workers, rather than eliminating positions due to genuine business needs.

**Supporting Cases**: 
- AA v RR (2019 WASAT 141): The tribunal considered the timing and circumstances of replacement as evidence of discriminatory intent.
- Johnston v Department of Communities (2019 WASAT 21): Demonstrated that actions inconsistent with stated reasons can indicate discrimination.

**Strength**: Strong

## Final Arguments

### ISSUE 1: Whether TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the basis of age when terminating his employment.

**RULE**: 
Under the Equal Opportunity Act, direct discrimination occurs when an employer treats an employee less favorably than they would treat a person of a different age in the same or not materially different circumstances. As established in Johnston v Department of Communities (2019 WASAT 21), the complainant must show they were treated less favorably than a real or hypothetical comparator would have been treated in similar circumstances.

**APPLICATION**: 
Mr. Chen, a 58-year-old Senior Software Engineer, was terminated despite "exceeds expectations" performance ratings just two months prior to termination. The statistical evidence shows that 78% of terminated employees were over 40 years old, despite this age group representing only 31% of the workforce. This creates a strong inference that age was a factor in the termination decision. Furthermore, the company posted a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities just three weeks after Mr. Chen's termination, suggesting the company's stated reason of "restructuring" was merely pretext for age discrimination. A younger employee with similar qualifications and performance would likely have been retained or offered the "Junior" position.

**CONCLUSION**: 
There is strong evidence that TechFuture Inc. directly discriminated against Mr. Chen on the basis of age. The statistical evidence, excellent performance record, and subsequent hiring for a similar position collectively establish a compelling case of direct discrimination. Strength: **Strong**

### ISSUE 2: Whether TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" constituted indirect discrimination against older employees.

**RULE**: 
Indirect discrimination occurs when an employer imposes a requirement or condition that has a disproportionate impact on people of a particular age group and is not reasonable in the circumstances. As established in Amazon v Department of Housing (2012 WASAT 11), the complainant must show that the condition disadvantages a protected group and that the condition is not reasonable.

**APPLICATION**: 
TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process resulted in the termination of a disproportionate number of employees over 40 years old (78% of terminated employees versus 31% of workforce). This statistical disparity strongly suggests that the criteria used in determining which positions to eliminate had a disparate impact on older workers. The company has not demonstrated that these criteria were reasonable or necessary for legitimate business purposes. The fact that the company subsequently advertised for a "Junior Software Engineer" with nearly identical responsibilities to Mr. Chen's former position further suggests that the restructuring was not genuine.

**CONCLUSION**: 
TechFuture Inc.'s "restructuring" process constituted indirect discrimination against older employees by imposing selection criteria that disproportionately impacted employees over 40 years old without reasonable justification. The statistical evidence and subsequent hiring actions demonstrate that the restructuring was likely designed to target older workers. Strength: **Strong**

### ISSUE 3: Whether TechFuture Inc.'s actions in replacing Mr. Chen with a "Junior Software Engineer" position constitute evidence of discriminatory intent.

**RULE**: 
Under discrimination law, actions taken by an employer after termination can provide evidence of discriminatory intent. As demonstrated in AA v RR (2019 WASAT 141), the timing and circumstances of replacement can be significant in determining whether the stated reason for termination was genuine or pretextual.

**APPLICATION**: 
Just three weeks after terminating Mr. Chen's employment, TechFuture Inc. posted a job opening for a "Junior Software Engineer" with responsibilities nearly identical to Mr. Chen's former position. This timing suggests that the company did not actually need to eliminate Mr. Chen's position due to restructuring, but rather wanted to replace him with a presumably younger and less expensive employee. The use of the term "Junior" in the job title, despite the responsibilities being nearly identical, further suggests an intent to hire a younger person for the role.

**CONCLUSION**: 
TechFuture Inc.'s actions in creating a "Junior Software Engineer" position with nearly identical responsibilities shortly after terminating Mr. Chen provide compelling evidence of discriminatory intent. This supports the conclusion that the stated reason of "restructuring" was merely pretext for age discrimination. Strength: **Strong**

1. JOHNSTON and DIRECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITIES (2019 WASAT 21) - Similarity: 0.4285
   Summary: ### 1. Introduction
This case involves Ms. Donna-Marie Johnston, an Aboriginal Wongutha/Martu woman, who lodged a complaint against her former employer under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) alleging racial discrimination and victimization. The complaint arose from a meeting held in November 2016 and a subsequent change in her employment position.

### 2. Background
Ms. Johnston was employed as a field worker by the respondent from March 2012 until November 2017. She claimed that during a meeting on November 3, 2016, she was treated unfairly compared to non-Aboriginal colleagues, and that her employment position was changed to a Section 50(d) position without proper consultation. After her complaint was initially dismissed by the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, it was referred to the State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) for further consideration.

### 3. Relevant Acts and Legislation
The case primarily references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), particularly:
- Section 36: Defines discrimination on the ground of race.
- Section 37: Addresses discrimination in employment.
- Section 50(d): Provides an exception for services promoting the welfare of a particular race.
- Section 67: Concerns victimization.
- Section 127: Outlines the Tribunal's powers regarding complaints.

### 4. Key Arguments
**Ms. Johnston's Arguments:**
- She was discriminated against during the November 3 meeting, treated less favorably than a non-Aboriginal person.
- The change of her employment position constituted racial discrimination.
- She experienced victimization due to threats made by her supervisor during the meeting.
- She sought $40,000 in compensation for the distress caused by the respondent's actions.

**Respondent's Arguments:**
- The respondent denied the discrimination claims, asserting there was insufficient evidence to support Ms. Johnston's assertions regarding the meeting.
- They conceded that the change in Ms. Johnston's position was discriminatory but contested the extent of the detriment and the compensation sought.
- They argued that the victimization claim was not established as Ms. Johnston did not indicate any intention to lodge a complaint during the meeting.

### 5. Key Insights
The Tribunal found that Ms. Johnston failed to prove her First Discrimination Claim regarding the meeting, as she did not provide evidence of how she was treated less favorably than a non-Aboriginal comparator. However, the Tribunal accepted the respondent's concession regarding the Second Discrimination Claim, acknowledging that the change in her employment position was discriminatory. The Tribunal also concluded that the victimization claim was not substantiated since Ms. Johnston did not indicate any intent to complain during the meeting.

### 6. Outcome
The Tribunal ruled in favor of Ms. Johnston regarding the Second Discrimination Claim, awarding her $2,000 in compensation for the humiliation and distress caused by the discriminatory change in her employment position. The Tribunal dismissed the First Discrimination Claim and the Victimization Claim, concluding that Ms. Johnston had not met the burden of proof required for those claims. The respondent was ordered to pay the compensation by May 10, 2019.
2. AA and RR (2019 WASAT 141) - Similarity: 0.4278
   Summary: ### Summary of State Administrative Tribunal Decision

1. **Introduction**  
   This case involves an applicant, referred to as AA, who alleges discrimination and victimization by her former employer, RR, following her conviction for drug-related offenses. AA claims that her employment was terminated due to her spent convictions, which she argues is unlawful under the Spent Convictions Act 1988 (WA) and the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA).

2. **Background**  
   AA worked as an office cleaner for RR for several years. In June 2018, she was charged with drug offenses and subsequently suspended by the Managing Director (MD) of RR, who was informed of the charges through an anonymous tip. After AA received spent convictions for her offenses, she sought to return to work but was ultimately informed by MD that she would not be re-engaged. AA lodged a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Commissioner, alleging discrimination based on her spent convictions and later claimed victimization due to threatening text messages sent by MD.

3. **Relevant Acts and Legislation**  
   - Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) (EO Act)
   - Spent Convictions Act 1988 (WA) (SC Act)

4. **Key Arguments**  
   - **AA's Arguments:** AA contended that RR discriminated against her by not allowing her to return to work after her spent convictions were granted, violating sections 17 and 18 of the SC Act. She also claimed victimization due to the threatening text messages from MD after she lodged her complaint.
   - **RR's Arguments:** MD argued that AA was not re-engaged due to legitimate concerns about her drug use and the potential safety risks associated with her working alone at night, rather than her spent convictions.

5. **Key Insights**  
   The Tribunal found that MD's decision not to re-engage AA was influenced by her admission of drug use and the associated safety concerns, which constituted a substantial reason for the decision. However, the Tribunal determined that this reason was intertwined with her spent convictions, leading to a finding of discrimination. The Tribunal did not find sufficient evidence to support AA's claim of victimization, concluding that MD did not intend to cause her detriment with his text messages.

6. **Outcome**  
   - **Winner:** AA won her discrimination claim, with the Tribunal ordering RR to pay her $8,000 in compensation for loss of income and damages due to discrimination based on her spent convictions.
   - **Loser:** AA lost her claim of victimization, as the Tribunal found no intention from MD to cause her detriment through his text messages. The Tribunal dismissed this part of her complaint, concluding that the messages did not substantively impact her. 

The Tribunal's decision underscores the importance of understanding the implications of spent convictions in employment contexts and the need for employers to navigate such situations carefully to avoid discrimination claims.
3. AMAZON and DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING (2012 WASAT 11) - Similarity: 0.4261
   Summary: ### 1. Introduction
The case involves Ms. Amazon, a resident of a property owned by the Department of Housing, who alleges discrimination based on her impairment, specifically Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS). She claims the Department failed to accommodate her health needs by requiring her to accept unsuitable housing and denying her requests for necessary alterations.

### 2. Background
Ms. Amazon, a 61-year-old woman, has lived in Homeswest accommodation since 1995. Due to her medical conditions, including MCS, she sought a priority transfer from her urban residence in Mosman Park to a more suitable property in Denmark. After being granted a transfer to a newly constructed aged persons unit, she lodged a complaint with the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, alleging discrimination on three grounds related to her housing situation.

### 3. Relevant Acts and Legislation
The case references the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA) (EO Act), particularly sections 66K and 66L, which address discrimination in the provision of accommodation and the refusal to permit reasonable alterations to accommodation based on impairment. It also mentions the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) (DD Act).

### 4. Key Arguments
Ms. Amazon's claims include:
- **Indirect Discrimination**: She argued that accepting the newly constructed property would exacerbate her condition, and she was pressured to accept it or risk losing her priority position.
- **Unlawful Discrimination**: She claimed the Department unlawfully refused her requests to make reasonable alterations to the property to alleviate her symptoms.
- **Indirect Discrimination**: She contended that requiring her to live in the property without necessary alterations constituted discrimination.

The Department countered that no unreasonable conditions were imposed and that Ms. Amazon's complaints were either out of time or lacked substance.

### 5. Key Insights
The Tribunal found that:
- Ms. Amazon's complaint was lodged within the required timeframe, as it was determined to have been made on 18 May 2009.
- No unreasonable conditions were imposed by the Department regarding the acceptance of the new property, as Ms. Amazon was not forced to accept it under duress.
- The requests for alterations were not deemed reasonable under the EO Act, as Ms. Amazon did not provide an undertaking to restore the property to its original condition and many requests were for work at the Department's expense.

### 6. Outcome
The Tribunal dismissed Ms. Amazon's application, ruling that:
- She did not prove that the Department imposed unreasonable conditions on her acceptance of the accommodation.
- The refusal of her requests for alterations did not constitute unlawful discrimination, as they did not meet the legal requirements under the EO Act.
- The Department's responses to her complaints were considered reasonable given the circumstances and the limited information available at the time. 

In conclusion, Ms. Amazon lost her case as the Tribunal found no basis for her claims of discrimination.
